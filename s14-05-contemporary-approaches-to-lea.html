Leaders such as Barack Obama, John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan, Mahatma Gandhi, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk (founder of the Republic of Turkey), and Winston Churchill are viewed as charismatic.

Each of these leaders is charismatic and is held responsible for the turnarounds of their companies.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch10_s04_s01_p03">While transformational leaders rely on their charisma, persuasiveness, and personal appeal to change and inspire their companies, transactional leaders use three other methods. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Contingent rewards</a><span class="glossdef">Rewarding employees for their accomplishments.</span></span> mean rewarding employees for their accomplishments. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Active management by exception</a><span class="glossdef">Leaving employees alone but at the same time proactively predicting potential problems and preventing them from occurring.</span></span> involves leaving employees to do their jobs without interference, but at the same time proactively predicting potential problems and preventing them from occurring. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Passive management by exception</a><span class="glossdef">Leaving employees alone but then coming to the rescue if anything goes wrong.</span></span> is similar in that it involves leaving employees alone, but in this method, the manager waits until something goes wrong before coming to the rescue.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch10_s04_s01_p04">Which leadership style do you think is more effective, transformational or transactional?

A., &amp; Piccolo, R. F. (2004). Transformational and transactional leadership: A meta-analytic test of their relative validity. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Applied Psychology, 89</em>, 755–768.</span> In fact, transformational leaders increase the intrinsic motivation of their followers, build more effective relationships with employees, increase performance and creativity of their followers, increase team performance, and create higher levels of commitment to organizational change efforts.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn10_041">Herold, D.

A., &amp; Piccolo, R. F. (2004). Transformational and transactional leadership: A meta-analytic test of their relative validity. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Applied Psychology, 89</em>, 755–768.</span> To maximize their effectiveness, leaders are encouraged to demonstrate both transformational and transactional styles. They should also monitor themselves to avoid demonstrating passive management by exception or leaving employees to their own devices until problems arise.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch10_s04_s01_p05">Why is transformational leadership more effective? The key factor may be <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">trust</a><span class="glossdef">The belief that the other party will show integrity, fairness, and predictability in one’s actions toward the other.</span></span>. Trust is the belief that the leader will show integrity, fairness, and predictability in his or her dealings with others. Research shows that when leaders demonstrate transformational leadership behaviors, followers are more likely to trust the leader. The tendency to trust in transactional leaders is substantially lower. Because transformational leaders express greater levels of concern for people’s well-being, and appeal to people’s values, followers are more likely to believe that the leader has a trustworthy character.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn10_043">Dirks, K. T., &amp; Ferrin, D. L. (2002). Trust in leadership: Meta-analytic findings and implications for research and practice. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Applied Psychology, 87</em>, 611–628.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch10_s04_s01_p06">Is transformational leadership genetic? Some people assume that charisma is something people are born with. You either have charisma or you don’t. However, research does not support this idea. We must acknowledge that there is a connection between some personality traits and charisma. Specifically, people who have a neurotic personality tend to demonstrate lower levels of charisma, and people who are extraverted tend to have higher levels of charisma. However, personality explains only around 10% of the variance in charisma.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn10_044">Bono, J. E., &amp; Judge, T. A. (2004).

            <p class="para">Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of Turkish Republic and its first president, is known as a charismatic leader. He is widely admired and respected in Turkey and around the world. His picture appears in all schools, state buildings, denominations of Turkish lira, and in many people’s homes in Turkey.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch10_s04_s01_p07">Even if charisma may be teachable, a more fundamental question remains: is it really needed? Charisma is only one element of transformational leadership and leaders can be effective without charisma. In fact, charisma has a dark side. For every charismatic hero such as Lee Iacocca, Steve Jobs, and Virgin’s Sir Richard Branson, there are charismatic personalities who harmed their organizations or nations, such as Adolph Hitler of Germany and Jeff Skilling of Enron. Leadership experts warn that when organizations are in a crisis, a board of directors or hiring manager may turn to heroes who they hope will save the organization and sometimes hire people who have no other particular qualifications outside of perceived charisma.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn10_046">Khurana, R.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch10_s04_s01_p08">An interesting study shows that when companies have performed well, their CEOs are perceived as charismatic, but CEO charisma has no relation to the future performance of a company.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn10_047">Agle, B.

An empirical analysis of the relationships among organizational performance, environmental uncertainty, and top management team perceptions of CEO charisma. <em class="emphasis">Academy of Management Journal, 49</em>, 161–174.</span> So, what we view as someone’s charisma may be largely because of their association with a successful company, and the success of a company depends on a large set of factors, including industry effects and historical performance. While it is true that charismatic leaders may sometimes achieve great results, the search for charismatic leaders under all circumstances may be irrational.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch10_s04_s02_p01">Leader-member exchange (LMX) theory proposes that the type of relationship leaders have with their followers (members of the organization) is the key to understanding how leaders influence employees.

In <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">high-quality LMX relationships</a><span class="glossdef">A high-quality, trust-based relationship between a leader and a follower.</span></span>, the leader forms a trust-based relationship with the member.

In fact, many leaders end up developing differentiated relationships with their followers. Within the same work group, they may have in-group members who are close to them and out-group members who are more distant. If you have ever been in a high-quality LMX relationship with your manager, you may attest to its advantages.

In performance-oriented cultures, how the leader distributes rewards seem to be the relevant factor, whereas in people-oriented cultures, whether the leader treats people with dignity is more relevant.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn10_058">Erdogan, B., Liden, R.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch10_s04_s02_p05">Should you worry if you do not have a high-quality relationship with your manager? One problem in a low-quality exchange is that you may not have access to the positive work environment available to the high-quality LMX members. Second, low LMX employees may feel that their situation is unfair. Even when their objective performance does not warrant it, those who have a good relationship with the leader tend to receive positive performance appraisals.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn10_059">Duarte, N. T., Goodson, J. R., &amp; Klich, N. R. (1994). Effects of dyadic quality and duration on performance appraisal. <em class="emphasis">Academy of Management Journal, 37</em>, 499–521.</span> Moreover, they are more likely to be given the benefit of the doubt. For example, when they succeed, the manager is more likely to think that they succeeded because they put forth a lot of effort and they had high abilities, whereas for low LMX members who perform objectively well, the manager is less likely to think so.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn10_060">Heneman, R. L., Greenberger, D. B., &amp; Anonyuo, C. (1989). Attributions and exchanges: The effects of interpersonal factors on the diagnosis of employee performance. <em class="emphasis">Academy of Management Journal, 32</em>, 466–476.</span> In other words, the leader may interpret the same situation differently, depending on which employee is involved and may reward low LMX employees less even when they are performing well. In short, those with a low-quality relationship with the leader may experience a work environment that may not be very supportive or fair.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch10_s04_s02_p06">Despite its negative consequences, we cannot say that all employees want to have a high-quality relationship with the leader. Some employees may genuinely dislike the leader and may not value the rewards in the leader’s possession. If the leader is not well liked in the company and is known as abusive or unethical, being close to such a person may imply guilt by association. For employees who have no interest in advancing their careers in the current company (such as a student employee who is working in retail but has no interest in retail as a career), having a low-quality exchange may afford the opportunity to just do one’s job without having to go above and beyond these job requirements. Finally, not all leaders are equally capable of influencing their employees by having a good relationship with their employees: It also depends on the power and influence of the leader in the overall company and how the leader himself or herself is treated within the company. Leaders who are more powerful will have more to share with employees who are close to them.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn10_061">Erdogan, B., &amp; Enders, J. (2007).

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch10_s04_s02_p07">What LMX theory implies for leaders is that one way of influencing employees is through the types of relationships leaders form with their employees. These relationships develop naturally because of the work-related and personal interactions between the manager and the employee. Because they occur naturally, some leaders may not be aware of the power that lies in them. These relationships have an important influence over employee attitudes and behaviors. In the worst case, they have the potential to create a negative work environment characterized by favoritism and unfairness. Therefore, managers are advised to be aware of how they build these relationships; put forth effort in cultivating these relationships consciously; be open to forming good relationships to people from all backgrounds regardless of their permanent characteristics such as sex, race, age, or disability status; and prevent these relationships from leading to an unfair work environment.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch10_s04_s03_p01">The early 21st century has been marked by a series of highly publicized corporate ethics scandals: between 2000 and 2003, we witnessed Enron, WorldCom, Arthur Andersen, Qwest, and Global Crossing shake investor confidence in corporations and leaders. The importance of ethical leadership and keeping long-term interests of stakeholders in mind is becoming more widely acknowledged.</p>

According to this approach, the primary mission of the leader is to develop employees and help them reach their goals. Servant leaders put their employees first, understand their personal needs and desires, empower them, and help them develop in their careers. Unlike mainstream management approaches, the overriding objective in servant leadership is not necessarily getting employees to contribute to organizational goals. Instead, servant leaders feel an obligation to their employees, customers, and the external community. Employee happiness is seen as an end in itself, and servant leaders sometimes sacrifice their own well-being to help employees succeed. In addition to a clear focus on having a moral compass, servant leaders are also interested in serving the community. In other words, their efforts to help others are not restricted to company insiders, and they are genuinely concerned about the broader community surrounding their company.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn10_062">Greenleaf, R.

In fact, many of today’s corporate leaders are not known for their humility! However, leaders who have adopted this approach attest to its effectiveness. David Wolfskehl, of Action Fast Print in New Jersey, founded his printing company when he was 24.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch10_s04_s04_p01">Leaders have to be a lot of things to a lot of people. They operate within different structures, work with different types of people, and they have to be adaptable. At times, it may seem that a leader’s smartest strategy would be to act as a social chameleon, changing his or her style whenever doing so seems advantageous. But this would lose sight of the fact that effective leaders have to stay true to themselves. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">The authentic leadership approach</a><span class="glossdef">Effective leaders who stay true to themselves.</span></span> embraces this value: its key advice is “be yourself.” Think about it: We all have different backgrounds, different life experiences, and different role models. These trigger events over the course of our lifetime that shape our values, preferences, and priorities. Instead of trying to fit into societal expectations about what a leader should be like, act like, or look like, authentic leaders derive their strength from their own past experiences. Thus, one key characteristic of authentic leaders is that they are self-aware. They are introspective, understand where they are coming from, and have a thorough understanding of their own values and priorities. Second, they are not afraid to act the way they are. In other words, they have high levels of personal integrity. They say what they think. They behave in a way consistent with their values—they practice what they preach. Instead of trying to imitate other great leaders, they find their style in their own personality and life experiences.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn10_067">Avolio, B. J., &amp; Gardner, W.

Therefore, in addition to self-reflection, feedback from others is needed to gain a true understanding of one’s behavior and effect on others.

            <h3 class="title">Key Takeaway</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-127512-ch10_s04_s04_p04">Contemporary approaches to leadership include transformational leadership, leader-member exchange, servant leadership, and authentic leadership. The transformational leadership approach highlights the importance of leader charisma, inspirational motivation, intellectual stimulation, and individualized consideration as methods of influence. Its counterpart is the transactional leadership approach, in which the leader focuses on getting employees to achieve organizational goals. According to leader-member exchange (LMX) approach, the unique, trust-based relationships leaders develop with employees is the key to leadership effectiveness. Recently, leadership scholars started to emphasize the importance of serving others and adopting a customer-oriented view in leadership; another recent focus is on the importance of being true to oneself as a leader. While each leadership approach focuses on a different element of leadership, effective leaders will need to change their style based on the demands of the situation as well as using their own values and moral compass.</p>
