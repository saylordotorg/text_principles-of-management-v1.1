    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch02_p02">Individuals bring a number of differences to work. They have a variety of personalities, values, and attitudes. When they enter into organizations, their stable or transient characteristics affect how they behave and perform. Moreover, companies hire people with the expectation that they have certain knowledge, skills, abilities, personalities, and values.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch02_p03">Recall that you are learning about the principles of management through the planning-organizing-leading-controlling (P-O-L-C) framework. Employees’ personalities, attitudes, and work behaviors affect how managers approach each P-O-L-C dimension. Here are just a few examples:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch02_l02">
        <li>When conducting environmental scanning during the planning process, a manager’s perceptions color the information that is absorbed and processed.</li>
        <li>Employee preferences for job design and enrichment (aspects of organizing) may be a function of individuals’ personalities and values.</li>
        <li>Leading effectively requires an understanding of employees’ personalities, values, and attitudes.</li>
        <li>Absenteeism can challenge a manager’s ability to control costs and performance (both at the group and individual levels).</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch02_p04">Therefore, it is important for managers to understand the individual characteristics that matter for employee and manager behaviors.</p>

<span class="title-prefix">2.1</span> Case in Point: SAS Institute Invests in Employees</h2>
    <div class="callout block" id="fwk-127512-02cases_n01">

        <p class="para" id="fwk-127512-02cases_p01">Who are your best customers? Which customers are bringing you the most profits and which are the least profitable? Companies are increasingly relying on complicated data mining software to answer these and other questions. More than 92% of the top 100 companies on the <em class="emphasis">Fortune</em> Global 500 list are using software developed by SAS Institute Inc., the world’s largest privately held software company, for their business intelligence and analytical needs. The Cary, North Carolina, company is doing extremely well by any measure. They have over 10,000 employees worldwide, operate in over 100 countries, ranked number 1 on <em class="emphasis">Fortune</em>’s 2010 list of the “Best Companies to Work For,” and reported $2.31 billion in revenue in 2009 (their 33rd consecutive year of growth and profitability). They reinvested 23% of their 2009 revenue into research and development (R&amp;D) activities. The company is quick to attribute their success to the performance and loyalty of their workforce. This is directly correlated with how they treat their employees.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-127512-02cases_p02">SAS has perfected the art of employee management. It has been ranked on <em class="emphasis">Fortune</em> magazine’s best places to work list every year since the list was first published. Employees seem to genuinely enjoy working at SAS and are unusually attached to the company, resulting in a turnover rate that is less than 4% in an industry where 20% is the norm. In fact, when Google designed their own legendary campus in California, they visited the SAS campus to get ideas.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-127512-02cases_p03">One thing SAS does well is giving its employees opportunities to work on interesting and challenging projects. The software developers have the opportunity to develop cutting-edge software to be used around the world. The company makes an effort to concentrate its business in the areas of analytics, which add the most value and help organizations best analyze disparate data for decision making, creating opportunities for SAS workers to be challenged. Plus, the company removes obstacles for employees. Equipment, policies, rules, and meetings that could impede productivity are eliminated.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-127512-02cases_p04">SAS has treated employees well in bad times as well as in good times. CEO Jim Goodnight is quoted as saying, “For 2010, I make the same promise that I did last year—SAS will have no layoffs. Too many companies worldwide sacrificed employees and benefits to cut costs in 2009. SAS took the opposite stance, and we have been rewarded in employee loyalty and overall success of the business. Maintaining this position throughout the downturn puts us in the best position to meet the expected market upturn.”</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-127512-02cases_p05">In addition, the company has a reputation as a pioneer when it comes to the perks it offers employees, but these perks are not given with a mentality of “offer everything but the kitchen sink.” There is careful thinking and planning behind the choice of perks the company offers. SAS conducts regular employee satisfaction surveys, and any future benefits and perks offered are planned in response to the results. The company wants to eliminate stressors and anything that dissatisfies from people’s lives. To keep employees healthy and fit, there are athletic fields; a full gym; a swimming pool; and tennis, basketball, and racquetball courts on campus. Plus, the company offers free on-site health care for employees, covers dependents at their fully staffed primary medical care center, and offers unlimited sick leave. The company understands that employees have a life and encourages employees to work reasonable hours and then go home to their families. In fact, a famous motto in the company is, “If you are working for more than 8 hours, you are just adding bugs.” SAS is truly one of the industry leaders in leveraging its treatment of people for continued business success.</p>

Each of us has a unique personality that differentiates us from other people, and understanding someone’s personality gives us clues about how that person is likely to act and feel in a variety of situations. To manage effectively, it is helpful to understand the personalities of different employees. Having this knowledge is also useful for placing people into jobs and organizations.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch02_s01_s01_p02">If personality is stable, does this mean that it does not change? You probably remember how you have changed and evolved as a result of your own life experiences, parenting style and attention you have received in early childhood, successes and failures you experienced over the course of your life, and other life events. In fact, personality does change over long periods of time. For example, we tend to become more socially dominant, more conscientious (organized and dependable), and more emotionally stable between the ages of 20 and 40, whereas openness to new experiences tends to decline as we age.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn02_001">Roberts, B.

Patterns of mean-level change in personality traits across the life course: A meta-analysis of longitudinal studies. <em class="emphasis">Psychological Bulletin, 132</em>, 1–25.</span> In other words, even though we treat personality as relatively stable, change occurs. Moreover, even in childhood, our personality matters, and it has lasting consequences for us. For example, studies show that part of our career success and job satisfaction later in life can be explained by our childhood personality.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn02_002">Judge, T.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch02_s01_s01_p03">Is our behavior in organizations dependent on our personality? To some extent, yes, and to some extent, no. While we will discuss the effects of personality for employee behavior, you must remember that the relationships we describe are modest correlations. For example, having a sociable and outgoing personality may encourage people to seek friends and prefer social situations. This does not mean that their personality will immediately affect their work behavior. At work, we have a job to do and a role to perform. Therefore, our behavior may be more strongly affected by what is expected of us, as opposed to how we want to behave. Especially in jobs that involve a lot of autonomy, or freedom, personality tends to exert a strong influence on work behavior,<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn02_003">Barrick, M.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch02_s01_s01_s01_p01">How many personality traits are there? How do we even know? In every language, there are many words describing a person’s personality. In fact, in the English language, more than 15,000 words describing personality have been identified. When researchers analyzed the traits describing personality characteristics, they realized that many different words were actually pointing to a single dimension of personality. When these words were grouped, five dimensions seemed to emerge, and these explain much of the variation in our personalities.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn02_004">Goldberg, L. R. (1990). An alternative “description of personality”: The big-five factor structure. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality &amp; Social Psychology, 59</em>, 1216–1229.</span> These five are not necessarily the only traits out there. There are other, specific traits that represent other dimensions not captured by the Big Five. Still, understanding them gives us a good start for describing personality.</p>

For example, Overnight Transportation in Atlanta found that using such tests reduced their on-the-job delinquency by 50%–100%.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn02_047">Emmett, A.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch02_s01_s03_p03">Yet, are these methods good ways of employee selection? Experts have not yet reached an agreement on this subject and the topic is highly controversial. Some experts cite data indicating that personality tests predict performance and other important criteria such as job satisfaction. However, we must understand that how a personality test is used influences its validity. Imagine filling out a personality test in class. You will probably fill it out as honestly as you can. Then, if your instructor correlates your personality scores with your class performance, we could say that the correlation is meaningful. But now imagine that your instructor tells you, before giving you the test, that based on your test scores, you will secure a coveted graduate assistant position, which comes with a tuition waiver and a stipend. In that case, would you still fill out the test honestly or would you try to make your personality look as “good” as possible?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch02_s01_s03_p04">In employee selection, where the employees with the “best” personalities will be the ones receiving a job offer, a complicating factor is that people filling out the survey do not have a strong incentive to be honest. In fact, they have a greater incentive to guess what the job requires and answer the questions in a way they think the company is looking for. As a result, the rankings of the candidates who take the test may be affected by their ability to fake. Some experts believe that this is a serious problem.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn02_048">Morgeson, F. P., Campion, M. A., Dipboye, R. L., Hollenbeck, J. R., Murphy, K., &amp; Schmitt, N.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch02_s01_s03_p05">Scores on personality self-assessments are distorted for other reasons beyond the fact that some candidates can fake better than others. Do we even know our own personalities? Are we the best person to ask this question? How supervisors, coworkers, and customers see our personality may matter more than how we see ourselves. Therefore, using self-report measures of performance may not be the best way of measuring someone’s personality.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn02_050">Mount, M. K., Barrick, M. R., &amp; Strauss, J. P. (1994). Validity of observer ratings of the big five personality factors. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Applied Psychology, 79</em>, 272–280.</span> We have our blind areas. We may also give “aspirational” answers. If you are asked whether you are honest, you may think “yes, I always have the intention to be honest.” This actually says nothing about your actual level of honesty.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch02_s01_s03_p06">Another problem with using these tests is the uncertain relationship between performance and personality. On the basis of research, personality is not a particularly strong indicator of how a person will perform. According to one estimate, personality only explains about 10%–15% of variation in job performance. Our performance at work depends on many factors, and personality does not seem to be the key factor for performance. In fact, cognitive ability (your overall mental intelligence) is a more powerful predictor of job performance. Instead of personality tests, cognitive ability tests may do a better job of predicting who will be good performers. Personality is a better predictor of job satisfaction and other attitudes, but screening people out on the assumption that they may be unhappy at work is a challenging argument to make in an employee selection context.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch02_s01_s03_p07">In any case, if an organization decides to use these tests for selection, it is important to be aware of their limitations. If they are used together with other tests, such as tests of cognitive abilities, they may contribute to making better decisions. The company should ensure that the test fits the job and actually predicts performance. This is called validating the test. Before giving the test to applicants, the company could give it to existing employees to find out the traits that are most important for success in this particular company and job. Then, in the selection context, the company can pay particular attention to those traits.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch02_s01_s03_p08">Finally, the company also needs to make sure that the test does not discriminate against people on the basis of sex, race, age, disabilities, and other legally protected characteristics. Rent-a-Center experienced legal difficulties when the test they used was found to violate the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The company used the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory for selection purposes, but this test was developed to diagnose severe mental illnesses; it included items such as “I see things or people around me others do not see.” In effect, the test served the purpose of a clinical evaluation and was discriminating against people with mental illnesses, which is a protected category under ADA.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn02_051">Heller, M.

            <p class="para" id="fwk-127512-ch02_s01_s04_p05">Personality traits and values are two dimensions on which people differ. Personality is the unique, relatively stable pattern of feelings, thoughts, and behavior that each individual displays. Big Five personality dimensions (openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and Neuroticism) are important traits; others that are particularly relevant for work behavior include self-efficacy, self-esteem, social monitoring, and proactive personality. While personality is a stronger influence over job attitudes, its relation to job performance is weaker. Some companies use personality testing to screen out candidates. Companies using personality tests are advised to validate their tests and use them to supplement other techniques with greater validity, such as tests of cognitive ability. Companies must also ensure that a test does not discriminate against any protected group. Values express a person’s life goals; they are similar to personality traits in that they are relatively stable over time. In the workplace, a person is more likely to accept a job that provides opportunities for value attainment. People are also more likely to remain in a job and career that satisfy their values.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch02_s02_p02">Our perception of the environment is not entirely rational.

If you are a sports fan, while scrolling down the pages, you may immediately see a news item describing the latest success of your team. If you are the mother of a picky eater, an advice column on toddler feeding may be the first thing you see when looking at the page. If you were recently turned down for a loan, an item of financial news may jump out at you.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch02_s02_s01_p01">Our visual perception definitely goes beyond the physical information available to us; this phenomenon is commonly referred to as “optical illusions.” Artists and designers of everything from apparel to cars to home interiors make use of optical illusions to enhance the look of the product. Managers rely on their visual perception to form their opinions about people and objects around them and to make sense of data presented in graphical form. Therefore, understanding how our visual perception may be biased is important.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch02_s02_s01_p03">Now, look at the next figure. What do you see? Most people look at this figure and see two faces <em class="emphasis">or</em> a goblet, depending on which color—<em class="emphasis">black or white</em>—they focus upon. Our visual perception is often biased because we do not perceive objects in isolation. The contrast between our focus of attention and the remainder of the environment may make an object appear bigger or smaller.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch02_s02_s01_p04">This principle is shown here in the third figure. At first glance, the circle on the left may appear bigger, but they are the same size. This is due to the visual comparison of the middle circle on the left with its surrounding circles, whereas the middle circle on the right is compared with the bigger circles surrounding it.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch02_s02_s01_p05">How do these tendencies influence behavior in organizations? The fact that our visual perception is faulty means that managers should not always take what they see at face value. Let’s say that you do not like one of your peers and you think that you saw this person surfing the Web during work hours. Are you absolutely sure, or are you simply filling the gaps? Have you really seen this person surf unrelated Web sites, or is it possible that the person was searching for work-related purposes? The tendency to fill in the gaps also causes our memory to be faulty. Imagine that you have been at a meeting where several people made comments that you did not agree with. After the meeting, you may attribute most of these comments to people you did not like. In other words, you may twist the reality to make your memories more consistent with your opinions of people.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch02_s02_s01_p06">The tendency to compare and contrast objects and people to each other also causes problems. For example, if you are a manager who has been given an office much smaller than the other offices on the floor, you may feel that your workspace is crowded and uncomfortable. If the same office is surrounded by smaller offices, you may actually feel that your office is comfortable and roomy. In short, our biased visual perception may lead to the wrong inferences about the people and objects around us.</p>

For example, people who suffer from extreme levels of self-enhancement tendencies may not understand why they are not getting promoted or rewarded, while those who have a tendency to self-efface may project low confidence and take more blame for their failures than necessary.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Social Perception</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch02_s02_s03_p01">How we perceive other people in our environment is also shaped by our biases. Moreover, how we perceive others will shape our behavior, which in turn will shape the behavior of the person we are interacting with.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch02_s02_s03_p02">One of the factors biasing our perception is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">stereotypes</a><span class="glossdef">Generalizations based on a group characteristic.</span></span>. Stereotypes are generalizations based on a group characteristic. For example, believing that women are more cooperative than men or that men are more assertive than women are stereotypes. Stereotypes may be positive, negative, or neutral. In the abstract, stereotyping is an adaptive function—we have a natural tendency to categorize the information around us to make sense of our environment. Just imagine how complicated life would be if we continually had to start from scratch to understand each new situation and each new person we encountered! What makes stereotypes potentially discriminatory and a perceptual bias is the tendency to generalize from a group to a particular individual. If the belief that men are more assertive than women leads to choosing a man over an equally qualified female candidate for a position, the decision will be biased, unfair, and potentially illegal.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch02_s02_s03_p03">Stereotypes often create a situation called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">self-fulfilling prophecy</a><span class="glossdef">When an established stereotype causes one to behave in a certain way, which leads the other party to behave in a way that makes the stereotype come true.</span></span>.

D., &amp; Berscheid, E. (1977). Social perception and interpersonal behavior: On the self-fulfilling nature of social stereotypes. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 35</em>, 656–666.</span> If you have a stereotype such as “Asians are friendly,” you are more likely to be friendly toward an Asian person. Because you are treating the other person more nicely, the response you get may also be nicer, which confirms your original belief that Asians are friendly. Of course, just the opposite is also true. Suppose you believe that “young employees are slackers.” You are less likely to give a young employee high levels of responsibility or interesting and challenging assignments. The result may be that the young employee reporting to you may become increasingly bored at work and start goofing off, confirming your suspicions that young people are slackers!</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch02_s02_s03_p04">Stereotypes persist because of a process called selective perception. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Selective perception</a><span class="glossdef">When we pay selective attention to parts of the environment while ignoring other parts.</span></span> simply means that we pay selective attention to parts of the environment while ignoring other parts, which is particularly important during the Planning process. Our background, expectations, and beliefs will shape which events we notice and which events we ignore. For example, an executive’s functional background will affect the changes he or she perceives in the environment.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn02_064">Waller, M. J., Huber, G. P., &amp; Glick, W. H. (1995). Functional background as a determinant of executives’ selective perception. <em class="emphasis">Academy of Management Journal, 38</em>, 943–974.</span> Executives with a background in sales and marketing see the changes in the demand for their product, while executives with a background in information technology may more readily perceive the changes in the technology the company is using. Selective perception may also perpetuate stereotypes because we are less likely to notice events that go against our beliefs. A person who believes that men drive better than women may be more likely to notice women driving poorly than men driving poorly. As a result, a stereotype is maintained because information to the contrary may not even reach our brain!</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch02_s02_s03_p05">Let’s say we noticed information that goes against our beliefs. What then? Unfortunately, this is no guarantee that we will modify our beliefs and prejudices. First, when we see examples that go against our stereotypes, we tend to come up with subcategories. For example, people who believe that women are more cooperative when they see a female who is assertive may classify her as a “career woman.” Therefore, the example to the contrary does not violate the stereotype and is explained as an exception to the rule.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn02_065">Higgins, E.

In one study, people in favor of and against the death penalty were shown two studies, one showing benefits for the death penalty while the other disconfirming any benefits.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch02_s02_s03_p06">One other perceptual tendency that may affect work behavior is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">first impressions</a><span class="glossdef">Initial thoughts and perceptions we form about people that tend to be stable and resilient to contrary information.</span></span>. The first impressions we form about people tend to have a lasting effect. In fact, first impressions, once formed, are surprisingly resilient to contrary information. Even if people are told that the first impressions were caused by inaccurate information, people hold on to them to a certain degree because once we form first impressions, they become independent from the evidence that created them.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn02_067">Ross, L., Lepper, M.

Imagine the first day that you met your colleague Anne. She treated you in a rude manner, and when you asked for her help, she brushed you off. You may form the belief that Anne is a rude and unhelpful person. Later on, you may hear that Anne’s mother is seriously ill, making Anne very stressed. In reality, she may have been unusually stressed on the day you first met her. If you had met her at a time when her stress level was lower, you could have thought that she is a really nice person. But chances are, your impression that she is rude and unhelpful will not change even when you hear about her mother. Instead, this new piece of information will be added to the first one: She is rude, unhelpful, and her mother is sick.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch02_s02_s03_p07">As a manager, you can protect yourself against this tendency by being aware of it and making a conscious effort to open your mind to new information.

            <p class="para" id="fwk-127512-ch02_s02_s03_p08">Perception is how we make sense of our environment in response to environmental stimuli. While perceiving our surroundings, we go beyond the objective information available to us and our perception is affected by our values, needs, and emotions. There are many biases that affect human perception of objects, self, and others. When perceiving the physical environment, we fill in the gaps and extrapolate from the available information. When perceiving others, stereotypes influence our behavior. Stereotypes may lead to self-fulfilling prophecies. Stereotypes are perpetuated because of our tendency to pay selective attention to aspects of the environment and ignore information inconsistent with our beliefs. Understanding the perception process gives us clues to understanding human behavior.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch02_s03_p01">How we behave at work often depends on how we feel about being there. Therefore, making sense of how people behave depends on understanding their work attitudes. An <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">attitude</a><span class="glossdef">Our opinions, beliefs, and feelings about aspects of our environment.</span></span> refers to our opinions, beliefs, and feelings about aspects of our environment.

If the number of studies conducted on job satisfaction is an indicator, job satisfaction is probably the most important job attitude. Institutions such as Gallup or the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) periodically conduct studies of job satisfaction to track how satisfied employees are at work. According to a recent Gallup survey, 90% of the employees surveyed said that they were at least somewhat satisfied with their jobs.

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch02_s03_p04">There is a high degree of overlap between job satisfaction and organizational commitment because things that make us happy with our job often make us more committed to the company as well.

Companies such as KFC and Long John Silver restaurants, the SAS Institute, Google, and others give periodic attitude surveys, which are used to track employee work attitudes. Companies can get more out of these surveys if responses are held confidential. If employees become concerned that their individual responses will be shared with their immediate manager, they are less likely to respond honestly. Moreover, success of these surveys depends on the credibility of management in the eye of employees. If management periodically collects these surveys but no action comes out of them, employees may adopt a more cynical attitude and start ignoring these surveys, hampering the success of future efforts. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Exit interviews</a><span class="glossdef">A meeting with the departing employee.</span></span> involve a meeting with the departing employee. This meeting is often conducted by a member of the human resource management department. If conducted well, this meeting may reveal what makes employees dissatisfied at work and give management clues about areas for improvement.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch02_s03_s02_p02">How strong is the attitude-behavior link? First of all, it depends on the attitude in question. Your attitudes toward your colleagues may influence whether you actually help them on a project, but they may not be a good predictor of whether you quit your job. Second, it is worth noting that attitudes are more strongly related to intentions to behave in a certain way, rather than actual behaviors. When you are dissatisfied with your job, you will have the intention to leave. Whether you actually leave will be a different story! Your leaving will depend on many factors, such as availability of alternative jobs in the market, your employability in a different company, and sacrifices you have to make while changing jobs. Thus, while the attitudes assessed through employee satisfaction surveys and exit interviews can provide some basis for predicting how a person might behave in a job, remember that behavior is also strongly influenced by situational constraints.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Key Takeaway</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-127512-ch02_s03_s02_p03">Work attitudes are the feelings we have toward different aspects of the work environment. Job satisfaction and organizational commitment are two key attitudes that are the most relevant to important outcomes. In addition to personality and fit with the organization, work attitudes are influenced by the characteristics of the job, perceptions of organizational justice and the psychological contract, relationships with coworkers and managers, and the stress levels experienced on the job. Many companies assess employee attitudes through surveys of worker satisfaction and through exit interviews. The usefulness of such information is limited, however, because attitudes create an intention to behave in a certain way, but they do not always predict actual behaviors.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch02_s04_p01">As we have seen in the earlier sections of this chapter, human beings bring in their personality, values, attitudes, perceptions, and other stable traits to work. Imagine that you are interviewing an employee who is proactive, creative, and willing to take risks. Would this person be a good job candidate? What behaviors would you expect this person to demonstrate?</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch02_s04_p02">The questions we pose here are misleading. While human beings bring their traits to work, every organization is also different, and every job is different. According to the interactionist perspective, behavior is a function of the person and the situation interacting with each other. Think about it. Would a shy person speak up in class? While a shy person may not feel like speaking if he or she is very interested in the subject, knows the answers to the questions, feels comfortable within the classroom environment, and knows that class participation is 30% of the course grade, this person may speak up in class regardless of his or her shyness. Similarly, the behavior you may expect from someone who is proactive, creative, and willing to take risks will depend on the situation.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch02_s04_p03">The fit between what we bring to our work environment and the environmental demands influences not only our behavior but also our work attitudes. Therefore, person-job fit and person-organization fit are positively related to job satisfaction and commitment. When our abilities match job demands, and when our values match company values, we tend to be more satisfied with our job and more committed to the company we work for.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn02_074">Kristof-Brown, A.

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch02_s04_p04">When companies hire employees, they are interested in assessing at least two types of fit. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Person-organization fit</a><span class="glossdef">The degree to which a person’s values, personality, goals, and other characteristics match those of the organization.</span></span> refers to the degree to which a person’s personality, values, goals, and other characteristics match those of the organization. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Person-job fit</a><span class="glossdef">The degree to which a person’s skill, knowledge, abilities, and other characteristics match the job demands.</span></span> is the degree to which a person’s knowledge, skills, abilities, and other characteristics match the job demands. (Human resources professionals often use the abbreviation KSAO to refer to these four categories of attributes.) Thus, someone who is proactive and creative may be a great fit for a company in the high-tech sector that would benefit from risk-taking individuals but may be a poor fit for a company that puts a high priority on routine and predictable behavior, such as a nuclear power plant. Similarly, this proactive and creative person may be a great fit for a field-based job such as marketing manager but a poor fit for an office job highly dependent on rules such as accountant.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch02_s04_p05">When people fit into their organization, they tend to be more satisfied with their jobs, more committed to their companies, are more influential in their company, and remain longer in their company.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn02_075">Anderson, C., Spataro, S.

        <p class="para" id="fwk-127512-ch02_s04_p06">While personality, values, attitudes, perceptions, and KSAOs are important, we need to keep in mind that behavior is jointly determined by the person and the situation. Certain situations bring out the best in people, and someone who is a poor performer in one job may turn into a star employee in a different job. Therefore, managers need to consider the individual and the situation when making Organizing decisions about the job or when engaging in Leadership activities like building teams or motivating employees.</p>

Which behaviors are we referring to here? We will focus on four key work behaviors: job performance, organizational citizenship behaviors, absenteeism, and turnover. Note that the first two behaviors are desirable ones, whereas the other two are often regarded as undesirable. While these four are not the only behaviors organizational behavior is concerned about, if you understand what we mean by these behaviors and the major influences over each type of behavior, you will gain more clarity about analyzing the behaviors of others in the workplace.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch02_s05_s01_p02">In many companies, job performance determines whether a person is promoted, rewarded with pay raises, given additional responsibilities, or fired from the job. Therefore, most employers observe and track job performance. This is done by keeping track of data on topics such as the number of sales the employee closes, the number of clients the employee visits, the number of defects found in the employee’s output, or the number of customer complaints or compliments received about the person’s work. In some jobs, objective performance data may not be available, and instead supervisor, coworker, customer, and subordinate assessments of the quality and quantity of work performed by the person become the indicators of job performance. Job performance is one of the main outcomes studied in organizational behavior and is an important variable managers must assess when they are engaged in the Controlling role.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch02_s05_s01_s01_p01">Under which conditions do people perform well, and what are the characteristics of high performers? These questions receive a lot of research attention. It seems that the most powerful influence over our job performance is our <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">general mental ability</a><span class="glossdef">Our reasoning abilities, verbal and numerical skills, analytical skills, or overall intelligence level.</span></span> also known as cognitive ability or intelligence, and often abbreviated as “g.” General mental ability can be divided into several components—reasoning abilities, verbal and numerical skills, and analytical skills—and it seems to be important across different situations. It seems that “g” starts influencing us early in our school days because it is strongly correlated with measures of academic success even in childhood.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn02_079">Kuncel, N.

A meta-analytic review of predictors of job performance for salespeople. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Applied Psychology, 83</em>, 586–597.</span> It seems that the influence of “g” on performance is important across different settings, but there is also variation. In jobs with high complexity, it is much more critical to have high general mental abilities. Examples of such jobs are manager, sales representative, engineer, and professions such as law and medicine. In jobs such as police officer and clerical worker, the importance of “g” for high performance is still important but weaker.</p>

When we feel that we are being fairly treated by the company, that our manager is supportive and rewards high performance, and when we trust the people we work with, we tend to perform better. Why? It seems that when we believe we are treated well, we want to reciprocate. Therefore, we treat the company well by performing our job more effectively.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch02_s05_s01_s01_p03">The <em class="emphasis">stress</em> we experience on the job also determines our performance level. When we are stressed, our mental energies are drained. Instead of focusing on the task at hand, we start concentrating on the stressor trying to cope with it. Because our attention and energies are diverted to dealing with stress, our performance suffers. Having role ambiguity and experiencing conflicting role demands are related to lower performance.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn02_081">Gilboa, S., Shirom, A., Fried, Y., &amp; Cooper, C.

Why is this the case?</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch02_s05_s01_s01_p05">It seems that happy workers have an inclination to be more engaged at work. They may <em class="emphasis">want</em> to perform better. They may be more motivated. But there are also exceptions. Think about this: Because you want to perform, does this mean that you will actually perform better? Chances are your skill level in performing the job will matter. There are also some jobs where performance depends on factors beyond an employee’s control, such as the pace of the machine they are working on. Because of this reason, in professional jobs such as with engineers and researchers, we see a stronger link between work attitudes and performance, as opposed to manual jobs such as assembly-line workers.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn02_085">Riketta, M. (2002). Attitudinal organizational commitment and job performance: A meta-analysis. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Organizational Behavior, 23</em>, 257–266.</span> Also, think about the alternative possibility: If you don’t like your job, does this mean that you will reduce your performance? Maybe up to a certain point, but there will be factors that prevent you from reducing your performance: such as the fear of getting fired, the desire to get a promotion so that you can get out of the job that you dislike so much, or your professional work ethic. As another example, among nurses, there seems to be a weak correlation between satisfaction and performance. Even when they are unhappy, nurses put a lot of effort into their work because they feel a moral obligation to help their patients. As a result, we should not expect a one-on-one relationship between satisfaction and performance. Still, the observed correlation between work attitudes and performance is important and has practical value.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch02_s05_s01_s01_p06">Finally, job performance has a modest relationship with <em class="emphasis">personality</em> traits, particularly conscientiousness.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Organizational Citizenship Behaviors</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch02_s05_s02_p01">While job performance refers to the performance of duties listed in one’s job description, organizational citizenship behaviors involve performing behaviors that are more discretionary. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Organizational citizenship behaviors (OCB)</a><span class="glossdef">Voluntary behaviors employees perform to help others and benefit the organization.</span></span> are voluntary behaviors employees perform to help others and benefit the organization. Helping a new coworker understand how things work in this company, volunteering to organize the company picnic, and providing suggestions to management about how to improve business processes are some examples of citizenship behaviors. These behaviors contribute to the smooth operation of business.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch02_s05_s02_p02">What are the major predictors of citizenship behaviors? Unlike performance, citizenship behaviors do not depend so much on one’s abilities. Job performance, to a large extent, depends on our general mental abilities. When you add the education, skills, knowledge, and abilities that are needed to perform well, the role of motivation on performance becomes more limited. As a result, just because someone is motivated will not mean that the person will perform well. For citizenship behaviors, in contrast, the motivation-behavior link is clearer. We help others around us if we feel motivated to do so, and managers, in the Leadership role, are responsible for motivating employees.</p>

A high-quality relationship with people we work with will mean that simply doing our job will not be enough to maintain the relationship.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Absenteeism</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch02_s05_s03_p01">Absenteeism refers to Unscheduled absences from work. Such absences are costly to companies because of their unpredictable nature, affecting a manager’s ability to Control the firm’s or department’s budget. When an employee has an unscheduled absence from work, companies struggle to find replacement workers at the last minute. This may involve hiring contingent workers, having other employees work overtime, or scrambling to cover for an absent coworker. The cost of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">absenteeism</a><span class="glossdef">Failure to appear at work.</span></span> to organizations is estimated at $74 billion. According to a Mercer Human Resource consulting study, 15% of the money spent on payroll is related to absenteeism.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn02_091">Conlin, M. (2007, November 12).

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch02_s05_s03_p02">What causes absenteeism? First, we need to look at the type of absenteeism. Some absenteeism is unavoidable and is related to <em class="emphasis">health reasons</em>. For example, reasons such as acute or serious illness, lower back pain, migraines, accidents one may have on or off the job, or acute stress are important reasons for absenteeism.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn02_092">Farrell, D., &amp; Stamm, C. L. (1988). Meta-analysis of the correlates of employee absence. <em class="emphasis">Human Relations, 41</em>, 211–227; Martocchio, J. J., Harrison, D. A., &amp; Berkson, H. (2000). Connections between lower back pain, interventions, and absence from work: A time-based meta-analysis. <em class="emphasis">Personnel Psychology, 53</em>, 595–624.</span> Health-related absenteeism is costly, but it would be unreasonable and unfair to institute organizational policies penalizing it. When an employee has a contagious illness, showing up at work will infect coworkers and will not be productive. If the illness is not contagious, it is still in the organization’s best interest for the employee to receive proper medical treatment and rest to promote a full recovery. Indeed, companies are finding that programs aimed at keeping workers healthy are effective in dealing with this type of absenteeism. Companies using wellness programs, educating employees about proper nutrition, helping them exercise, and rewarding them for healthy habits have reported reduced absenteeism.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn02_093">Parks, K. M., &amp; Steelman, L. A. (2008). Organizational wellness programs: A meta-analysis. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 13</em>, 58–68.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch02_s05_s03_p03"><em class="emphasis">Work/life balance</em> is another common reason for absences. Staying home to care for a sick family member, attending the wedding or funeral of a loved one, and skipping work to study for an exam are all common reasons for unscheduled absences. Companies may deal with these by giving employees more flexibility in work hours. If employees can manage their own time, they are less likely to be absent. Conversely, when a company has “sick leave” but no other leave for social and family obligations, they may fake being sick and use their “sick leave.” One solution is to have a single paid time off policy that would allow workers to balance work and life and allow companies to avoid unscheduled absences. Organizations such as Lahey Clinic at Burlington, Massachusetts, have found this to be effective in dealing with unscheduled absences. Some companies such as IBM got rid of sick leave altogether and instead allow employees to take as much time off as they need, so long as the work gets done.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn02_094">Cole, C. L. (2002, September). Sick of absenteeism? Get rid of sick days. <em class="emphasis">Workforce, 81</em>(9), 56–61; Conlin, M. (2007, November 12).

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch02_s05_s03_p04">Sometimes, absenteeism is a form of work withdrawal and a step followed by turnover. In other words, <em class="emphasis">poor work attitudes</em> lead to absenteeism. When employees are dissatisfied with their work or have low organizational commitment, they are likely to be absent more often. Thus, absenteeism is caused by the desire to avoid an unpleasant work environment. In this case, management may deal with absenteeism by investigating the causes of dissatisfaction and dealing with them.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch02_s05_s03_p05">Are there personal factors contributing to absenteeism? Research does not reveal a consistent link between personality and absenteeism, but there is one demographic criterion that predicts absenteeism: age. Interestingly, and against some stereotypes that increased age would bring more health problems, research shows that age is negatively related to both frequency and duration of absenteeism. That is, younger workers are the ones more likely to be absent. Because of reasons that include higher loyalty to their company and a stronger work ethic, older employees are less likely be absent from work.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn02_095">Martocchio, J.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Turnover</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch02_s05_s04_p01">Turnover refers to an employee’s leaving an organization. Employee <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">turnover</a><span class="glossdef">An employee’s leaving an organization.</span></span> has potentially harmful consequences, such as poor customer service and poor company-wide performance. When employees leave, their jobs still need to be performed by someone, so companies spend time recruiting, hiring, and training new employees, all the while suffering from lower productivity. Yet, not all turnover is bad. Turnover is particularly a problem when high-performing employees leave, while a poor performer’s leaving may actually give the company a chance to improve productivity and morale.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch02_s05_s04_p02">Why do employees leave? An employee’s <em class="emphasis">performance</em> level is an important reason. People who perform poorly are actually more likely to leave. These people may be fired, may be encouraged to quit, or may quit because of their fear of being fired. Particularly if a company has pay-for-performance systems, poor performers will find that they are not earning much due to their below-standard performance. This gives poor performers an extra incentive to leave. This does not mean that high performers will definitely stay with a company. High performers may find it easier to find alternative jobs, so when they are unhappy, they can leave more quickly.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch02_s05_s04_p03"><em class="emphasis">Work attitudes</em> are often the primary culprit in why people leave. When workers are unhappy at work, and when they do not feel committed to their companies, they are more likely to leave. Loving the things you do, being happy with the opportunities for advancement within the company, being happy about pay are all aspects of our work attitudes relating to turnover. Of course, the link between work attitudes and turnover is not direct. When employees are unhappy, they will have the intention to leave and may start looking for a job. But their ability to actually leave will depend on many factors, such as their employability and the condition of the job market. For this reason, when national and regional unemployment is high, many people who are unhappy will still continue to work for their current company. When the economy is doing well, people will start moving to other companies in response to being unhappy. Understanding the connection between employee happiness and turnover, many companies make an effort to make employees happy. SAS Institute employees have a 35-hour workweek and enjoy amenities such as a swimming pool and child care at work. The company’s turnover is around 4%–5%, in comparison to the industry averages ranging from 12%–20%.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn02_096">Carsten, J. M., &amp; Spector, P. E. (1987).

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch02_s05_s04_p04">People are more likely to quit their jobs if they experience <em class="emphasis">stress</em> at work as well. Stressors such as role conflict and role ambiguity drain energy and motivate people to seek alternatives. For example, call center employees experience a great deal of stress because of poor treatment from customers, long work hours, and constant monitoring of their every action. Companies such as EchoStar realize that one method that is effective in retaining their best employees is to give them opportunities to move to higher-responsibility jobs elsewhere in the company. When a stressful job is a step toward a more desirable job, employees seem to stick around longer.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn02_097">Badal, J.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch02_s05_s04_p05">There are also individual differences in whether people leave or stay. For example, <em class="emphasis">personality</em> is a factor in the decision to quit one’s job. People who are conscientious, agreeable, and emotionally stable are less likely to quit their jobs. Many explanations are possible. People with these personality traits may perform better at work, which leads to lower quit rates. Or, they may have better relations with coworkers and managers, which is a factor in their retention. Whatever the reason, it seems that some people are likely to stay longer at any given job regardless of the circumstances.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn02_098">Salgado, J. F. (2002).

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch02_s05_s04_p06">Whether we leave a job or stay also depends on our <em class="emphasis">age</em> and <em class="emphasis">how long we have been there</em>. It seems that younger employees are more likely to leave. This is not surprising because people who are younger often have fewer responsibilities such as supporting a household or having dependents. As a result, they can quit a job they don’t like much more easily. They may also have higher expectations and thus be more easily disappointed when a job proves to be less rewarding than they had imagined. Similarly, people who have been with a company for a short period of time can quit more easily. For example, Sprint Nextel found that many of their new hires were likely to quit within 45 days of their hiring dates. When they investigated, they found that newly hired employees were experiencing a lot of stress from avoidable problems such as unclear job descriptions or problems with hooking up their computers. Sprint was able to solve the turnover problem by paying special attention to orienting new hires. New employees experience a lot of stress at work, and there is usually not much keeping them in the company such as established bonds to a manager or colleagues. New employees may even have ongoing job interviews with other companies when they start working. This, too, gives them the flexibility to leave more easily.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Key Takeaway</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-127512-ch02_s05_s04_p07">Employees demonstrate a wide variety of positive and negative behaviors at work. Among these, four are critically important and have been extensively studied in the OB literature. Job performance is the degree of success with which one accomplishes the tasks listed in one’s job description. A person’s abilities, particularly general mental ability, are the main predictor of job performance in many occupations. How we are treated at work, the level of stress experienced at work, work attitudes, and, to a lesser extent, our personality are also factors relating to one’s job performance. Citizenship behaviors are tasks helpful to the organization that go above and beyond one’s job description. Performance of citizenship behaviors are less a function of our abilities and more of motivation. How we are treated at work, personality, work attitudes, and our age are the main predictors of citizenship. Among negative behaviors employees demonstrate, absenteeism and turnover are critically important. People who experience health problems and work/life balance issues are prone to more absenteeism. Poor work attitudes are also related to absenteeism, and younger employees are more likely to be absent from work, especially when dissatisfied. Turnover is higher among low performers, people who have negative work attitudes, and those who experience a great deal of stress. Personality and being younger are personal predictors of turnover.</p>

<em class="emphasis">Get accurate information about the job and the company</em>. Ask detailed questions about what life is like in this company. Do your research. Read about the company; use your social network to understand the company’s culture.</li>
        <li>
<em class="emphasis">Develop good relationships at work</em>. Make friends. Try to get a mentor if your company does not have a formal mentoring program. Approach a person you admire and attempt to build a relationship with this person. An experienced mentor can be a great help in navigating life at a company. Your social network can help you weather the bad days and provide you with emotional and instrumental support during your time at a company as well as afterward.</li>
        <li>Pay is important, but <em class="emphasis">job characteristics matter more to your job satisfaction</em>. So don’t sacrifice the job itself for a bit more money. When choosing a job, look at the level of challenge and the potential of the job to make you feel engaged.</li>
        <li>
<em class="emphasis">Be proactive in managing organizational life</em>. If the job is stressful, cope with it by effective time management and having a good social network, as well as being proactive in getting to the source of stress. If you don’t have enough direction, ask for it!</li>
        <li>
<em class="emphasis">Know when to leave</em>. If the job makes you unhappy over an extended period of time and there is little hope of solving the problems, it may be time to look elsewhere.</li>
