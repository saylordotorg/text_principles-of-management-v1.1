        <h2 class="title editable block">Common Barriers to Effective Teams</h2>
        <div class="section" id="fwk-127512-ch13_s04_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Challenges of Knowing Where to Begin</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch13_s04_s01_s01_p01">At the start of a project, team members may be at a loss as to how to begin. Also, they may have reached the end of a task but are unable to move on to the next step or put the task to rest.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch13_s04_s01_s01_p02">Floundering often results from a lack of clear goals, so the remedy is to go back to the team’s mission or plan and make sure that it is clear to everyone. Team leaders can help move the team past floundering by asking, “What is holding us up? Do we need more data? Do we need assurances or support? Does anyone feel that we’ve missed something important?”</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Dominating Team Members</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch13_s04_s01_s02_p01">Some team members may have a dominating personality that encroaches on the participation or airtime of others. This overbearing behavior may hurt the team morale or the momentum of the team.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch13_s04_s01_s02_p02">A good way to overcome this barrier is to design a team evaluation to include a “balance of participation” in meetings. Knowing that fair and equitable participation by all will affect the team’s performance evaluation will help team members limit domination by one member and encourage participation from all members, even shy or reluctant ones. Team members can say, “We’ve heard from Mary on this issue, so let’s hear from others about their ideas.”</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Poor Performance of Some Team Members</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch13_s04_s01_s03_p01">Research shows that teams deal with poor performers in different ways, depending on members’ perceptions of the reasons for poor performance.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn13_051">Jackson, C. L., &amp; LePine, J. A. (2003). Peer responses to a team’s weakest link: A test and extension of LePine and Van Dyne’s model. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Applied Psychology</em>, <em class="emphasis">88</em>, 459–475.</span> In situations in which the poor performer is perceived as lacking in ability, teams are more likely to train the member. In situations in which members perceive the individual as simply being low on motivation, they are more likely to try to motivate or reject the poor performer.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch13_s04_s01_s03_p02">Keep in mind that justice is an important part of keeping individuals working hard for the team.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn13_052">Colquitt, J.

            <h2 class="title editable block">Poorly Managed Team Conflict</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch13_s04_s01_s04_p01">Disagreements among team members are normal and should be expected. Healthy teams raise issues and discuss differing points of view because that will ultimately help the team reach stronger, more well-reasoned decisions. Unfortunately, sometimes disagreements arise because of personality issues or feuds that predated the teams’ formation.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch13_s04_s01_s04_p02">Ideally, teams should be designed to avoid bringing adversaries together on the same team. If that is not possible, the next best solution is to have adversaries discuss their issues privately, so the team’s progress is not disrupted. The team leader or other team member can offer to facilitate the discussion. One way to make a discussion between conflicting parties meaningful is to form a behavioral contract between the two parties. That is, if one party agrees to do X, the other will agree to do Y.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn13_053">Scholtes, P. (1988). <em class="emphasis">The team handbook</em>.
