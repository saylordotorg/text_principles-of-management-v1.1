        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch05_s02_s01_p02">This quote from English poet Robert Burns is especially applicable to strategy. While we have been discussing strategy and strategizing as if they were the outcome of a rational, predictable, analytical process, your own experience should tell you that a fine plan does not guarantee a fine outcome. Many things can happen between the development of the plan and its realization, including (but not limited to): (1) the plan is poorly constructed, (2) competitors undermine the advantages envisioned by the plan, or (3) the plan was good but poorly executed. You can probably imagine a number of other factors that might undermine a strategic plan and the results that follow.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch05_s02_s01_p03">How organizations make strategy has emerged as an area of intense debate within the strategy field. Henry Mintzberg and his colleagues at McGill University distinguish intended, deliberate, realized, and emergent strategies.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn05_008">Mintzberg, H. (1987, July–August). Crafting strategy. <em class="emphasis">Harvard Business Review</em>, pp. 66–75; Mintzberg, H. (1996). The entrepreneurial organization. In H. Mintzberg &amp; J. B.

Even here, rationality is limited and the intended strategy is the result of a process of negotiation, bargaining, and compromise, involving many individuals and groups within the organization. However, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">realized strategy</a><span class="glossdef">The actual strategy that is implemented and comes to fruition as a consequence of implementation and other internal and external factors.</span></span>—the actual strategy that is implemented—is only partly related to that which was intended (Mintzberg suggests only 10%–30% of intended strategy is realized).</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch05_s02_s01_p04">The primary determinant of realized strategy is what Mintzberg terms <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">emergent strategy</a><span class="glossdef">A pattern of action that develops over time in an organization in the absence of vision, mission, and goals, or despite missions and goals, or in addition to what was conceived of in the intended and deliberate strategies.</span></span>—the decisions that emerge from the complex processes in which individual managers interpret the intended strategy and adapt to changing external circumstances.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn05_009">See Mintzberg, H.

Analysis of Honda’s successful entry into the U.S. motorcycle market has provided a battleground for the debate between those who view strategy making as primarily a rational, analytical process of deliberate planning (the <em class="emphasis">design school</em>) and those that envisage strategy as emerging from a complex process of organizational decision making (the <em class="emphasis">emergence</em> or <em class="emphasis">learning school</em>).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn05_010">The two views of Honda are captured in two Harvard cases: <em class="emphasis">Honda [A]</em>. (1989). Boston: Harvard Business School, Case 384049, and <em class="emphasis">Honda [B]</em>. (1989). Boston: Harvard Business School, Case 384050.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch05_s02_s01_p05">Although the debate between the two schools continues,<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn05_011">For further debate of the Honda case, see Mintzberg, H., Pascale, R.

            <h2 class="title editable block">How Is Strategy Made?</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch05_s02_s02_s01_p01">Robert Grant, author of <em class="emphasis">Contemporary Strategy Analysis</em>, shares his view of how strategy is made as follows.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn05_012">Grant, R. M. (2002). <em class="emphasis">Contemporary strategy analysis</em> (4th ed., pp. 25–26). New York: Blackwell.</span> For most organizations, strategy making combines design and emergence. The deliberate design of strategy (through formal processes such as board meetings and strategic planning) has been characterized as a primarily top-down process. Emergence has been viewed as the result of multiple decisions at many levels, particularly within middle management, and has been viewed as a bottom-up process. These processes may interact in interesting ways. At Intel, the key historic decision to abandon memory chips and concentrate on microprocessors was the result of a host of decentralized decisions taken at divisional and plant level that were subsequently acknowledged by top management and promulgated as strategy.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn05_013">Burgelman, R. A., &amp; Grove, A. (1996, Winter). Strategic dissonance. <em class="emphasis">California Management Review, 38</em>, 8–28.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch05_s02_s02_s01_p02">In practice, both design and emergence occur at all levels of the organization. The strategic planning systems of large companies involve top management passing directives and guidelines down the organization and the businesses passing their draft plans up to corporate. Similarly, emergence occurs throughout the organization—opportunism by CEOs is probably the single most important reason why realized strategies deviate from intended strategies. What we can say for sure is that the role of emergence relative to design increases as the business environment becomes increasingly volatile and unpredictable.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch05_s02_s02_s01_p03">Organizations that inhabit relatively stable environments—the Roman Catholic Church and national postal services—can plan their strategies in some detail. Organizations whose environments cannot be forecast with any degree of certainty—a gang of car thieves or a construction company located in the Gaza Strip—can establish only a few strategic principles and guidelines; the rest must emerge as circumstances unfold.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">What’s the Best Way to Make Strategy?</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch05_s02_s02_s02_p01">Mintzberg’s advocacy of strategy making as an iterative process involving experimentation and feedback is not necessarily an argument against the rational, systematic design of strategy. The critical issues are, first, determining the balance of design and emergence and, second, how to guide the process of emergence. The strategic planning systems of most companies involve a combination of design and emergence. Thus, headquarters sets guidelines in the form of vision and mission statements, business principles, performance targets, and capital expenditure budgets. However, within the strategic plans that are decided, divisional and business unit managers have considerable freedom to adjust, adapt, and experiment.</p>

                <h3 class="title">Key Takeaway</h3>
                <p class="para" id="fwk-127512-ch05_s02_s02_s02_p02">You learned about the processes surrounding strategy development. Specifically, you saw the difference between intended and realized strategy, where intended strategy is essentially the desired strategy, and realized strategy is what is actually put in place. You also learned how strategy is ultimately made. Ultimately, the best strategies come about when managers are able to balance the needs for design (planning) with being flexible enough to capitalize on the benefits of emergence.</p>
