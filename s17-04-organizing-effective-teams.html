        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch13_s03_s01_p01">A key to successful team design is to have clear norms, roles, and expectations among team members. Problems such as social loafing or groupthink can be avoided by paying careful attention to team member differences and providing clear definitions for roles, expectancy, measurement, and rewards.</p>

Just as new employees learn to understand and share the assumptions, norms, and values that are part of an organization’s culture, they also must learn the norms of their immediate team. This understanding helps teams be more cohesive and perform better. Norms are a powerful way of ensuring coordination within a team. For example, is it acceptable to be late to meetings? How prepared are you supposed to be at the meetings? Is it acceptable to criticize someone else’s work? These norms are shaped early during the life of a team and affect whether the team is productive, cohesive, and successful.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Team Meetings</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch13_s03_s02_p01">Anyone who has been involved in a team knows it involves team meetings. While few individuals relish meetings, they serve an important function in terms of information sharing and decision making. They also serve an important social function and can help to build team cohesion and a task function in terms of coordination. Unfortunately, we’ve all attended lengthy meetings that were a waste of time and where little happened that couldn’t have been accomplished by reading an e-mail in five minutes. To run effective meetings, it helps to think of meetings in terms of three sequential steps.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn13_049">Haynes, M. E.

            <h2 class="title editable block">Before the Meeting</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch13_s03_s02_s01_p01">Much of the effectiveness of a meeting is determined before the team gathers. There are three key things you can do to ensure the team members get the most out of their meeting.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch13_s03_s02_s01_p02"><em class="emphasis">First, ask yourself: Is a meeting needed</em>? Leaders should do a number of things before the meeting to help make it effective. The first thing is to be sure a meeting is even needed. If the meeting is primarily informational, ask yourself whether it is imperative that the group fully understands the information and whether future decisions will be built on this information. If so, a meeting may be needed. If not, perhaps simply communicating with everyone in a written format will save valuable time. Similarly, decision-making meetings make the most sense when the problem is complex and important, there are questions of fairness to be resolved, and commitment is needed moving forward.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch13_s03_s02_s01_p03"><em class="emphasis">Second, create and distribute an agenda</em>. An agenda is important in helping to inform those invited about the purpose of the meeting. It also helps organize the flow of the meeting and keep the team on track.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch13_s03_s02_s01_p04"><em class="emphasis">Third, send a reminder before the meeting</em>. Reminding everyone of the purpose, time, and location of the meeting helps everyone prepare themselves. Anyone who has attended a team meeting only to find there is no reason to meet because members haven’t completed their agreed-upon tasks knows that, as a result, team performance or morale can be negatively affected. Follow up to make sure everyone is prepared. As a team member, inform others immediately if you will not be ready with your tasks so they can determine whether the meeting should be postponed.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">During the Meeting</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch13_s03_s02_s02_p01">During the meeting, there are several things you can do to make sure the team starts and keeps on track.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch13_s03_s02_s02_p02"><em class="emphasis">Start the meeting on time</em>. Waiting for members who are running late only punishes those who are on time and reinforces the idea that it’s OK to be late. Starting the meeting promptly sends an important signal that you are respectful of everyone’s time.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch13_s03_s02_s02_p03"><em class="emphasis">Follow the meeting agenda</em>. Veering off agenda communicates to members that it is not important. It also makes it difficult for others to keep track of where you are in the meeting and can facilitate important points not being addressed.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch13_s03_s02_s02_p04"><em class="emphasis">Manage group dynamics for full participation</em>. As you’ve seen in this chapter, there are a number of group dynamics that can limit a team’s functioning. Be on the lookout for full participation and engagement from all team members as well as any potential problems such as social loafing, group conflict, or groupthink.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch13_s03_s02_s02_p05"><em class="emphasis">Summarize the meeting with action items</em>. Be sure to clarify team member roles moving forward. If individual’s tasks are not clear, chances are role confusion will arise later. There should be clear notes from the meeting regarding who is responsible for each action item and the timeframes associated with next steps.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch13_s03_s02_s02_p06"><em class="emphasis">End the meeting on time</em>. This is vitally important as it shows that you respect everyone’s time and are organized. If another meeting is needed to follow up, schedule it later, but don’t let the meeting run over.</p>

                <p class="para" id="fwk-127512-ch13_s03_s02_s03_p02">Much like group development, team socialization takes place over the life of the team. The stages move from evaluation to commitment to role transition. Team norms are important for the team process and help to establish who is doing what for the team and how the team will function. Creating a team contract helps with this process. Keys to address in a team contract are team values and goals, team roles and leadership, team decision making, team communication expectations, and how team performance is characterized. Team meetings can help a team coordinate and share information. Effective meetings include preparation, management during the meeting, and follow up on action items generated in the meeting.</p>
