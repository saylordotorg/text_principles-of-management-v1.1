The ability to effectively communicate is a necessary condition for successfully planning, organizing, leading, and controlling. Communication is vital to organizations—it’s how we coordinate actions and achieve goals. It is defined in the <em class="emphasis">Merriam-Webster’s</em> dictionary as “a process by which information is exchanged between individuals through a common system of symbols, signs, or behavior.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn12_001"><em class="emphasis">Merriam-Webster online dictionary</em>.

And in some work arenas, like operating rooms and airplane cockpits, communication can be a matter of life and death.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch12_s01_p02">So, just how prevalent is the problem of miscommunication in the workplace? You may be surprised to learn that the relationship between miscommunication and negative outcomes is strong. A recent NASA study suggests that deficient interpersonal communication was a causal factor in approximately 70%–80% of aviation accidents over a 20-year period.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn12_004">Baron, R.

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch12_s01_p03">Poor communication can also lead to lawsuits. For example, you might think that malpractice suits are filed against doctors based on the outcome of their treatments alone. But a 1997 study of malpractice suits found that a primary influence on whether a doctor is sued is that doctor’s communication style. While the combination of a bad outcome and patient unhappiness can quickly lead to litigation, a warm, personal communication style leads to greater patient satisfaction. And satisfied patients are less likely to sue.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn12_005">Communications skills cut malpractice risk—study reveals most important reason that patients decide to file malpractice suits is because of poor communication by physicians and not medical errors.

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch12_s01_p04">For leaders and organizations, poor communication costs money and wastes time. One study found that 14% of each workweek is wasted on poor communication.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn12_006">Armour, S. (1998, September 30). Failure to Communicate Costly for Companies. <em class="emphasis">USA Today</em>, 1A.</span> In contrast, effective communication is an asset for organizations and individuals alike. Effective communication skills, for example, are an asset for job seekers. A recent study of recruiters at 85 business schools ranked communication and interpersonal skills as the highest skills they were looking for, with 89% of the recruiters saying they were important.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn12_007">Alsop, R.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch12_s01_s01_p01">Communication fulfills three main functions within an organization: (1) transmitting information, (2) coordinating effort, and (3) sharing emotions and feelings. All these functions are vital to a successful organization. Transmitting information is vital to an organization’s ability to function. Coordinating effort within the organization helps people work toward the same goals. Sharing emotions and feelings bonds teams and unites people in times of celebration and crisis. Effective communication helps people grasp issues, build rapport with coworkers, and achieve consensus. So, how can we communicate effectively? The first step is to understand the communication process.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch12_s01_s01_p02">We all exchange information with others countless times a day, by phone, e-mail, printed word, and of course, in person. Let’s take a moment to see how a typical communication works using the Process Model of Communication as a guide.</p>

Noise can be external in the environment (such as distractions) or it can be within the Receiver. For example, the Receiver may be highly nervous and unable to pay attention to the Message.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch12_s01_s01_p11">Picture the next scene. The place: a staff meeting. The time: a few days later. The boss believes her Message has been received.</p>
