Even though culture may not be immediately observable, identifying a set of values that might be used to describe an organization’s culture helps us identify, measure, and manage culture more effectively. For this purpose, several researchers have proposed various culture typologies. One typology that has received a lot of research attention is the Organizational Culture Profile (OCP) where culture is represented by seven distinct values.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn08_007">Chatman, J.

W. L. Gore consistently manages to innovate and capture the majority of market share in a wide variety of industries, in large part because of its unique culture.

This information is put into a computer system and used to provide better service to returning customers.

M. (1987). Organizational culture: Internal and external fits. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Management, 13</em>, 647–658; Chatman, J. A., &amp; Eunyoung Cha, S. (2003). Leading by leveraging culture. <em class="emphasis">California Management Review</em>, <em class="emphasis">45</em>, 20–34.</span>—that is, a culture in which most employees in the organization show consensus regarding the values of the company. The stronger a company’s culture, the more likely it is to affect the way employees think and behave. For example, cultural values emphasizing customer service will lead to higher-quality customer service if there is widespread agreement among employees on the importance of customer-service-related values.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn08_024">Schneider, B., Salvaggio, A., &amp; Subirats, M.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch08_s02_s02_p02">It is important to realize that a strong culture may act as an asset or a liability for the organization, depending on the types of values that are shared. For example, imagine a company with a culture that is strongly outcome-oriented. If this value system matches the organizational environment, the company may perform well and outperform its competitors. This is an asset as long as members are behaving ethically. However, a strong outcome-oriented culture coupled with unethical behaviors and an obsession with quantitative performance indicators may be detrimental to an organization’s effectiveness. Enron is an extreme example of this dysfunctional type of strong culture.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch08_s02_s02_p03">One limitation of a strong culture is the difficulty of changing it. In an organization where certain values are widely shared, if the organization decides to adopt a different set of values, unlearning the old values and learning the new ones will be a challenge because employees will need to adopt new ways of thinking, behaving, and responding to critical events. For example, Home Depot had a decentralized, autonomous culture where many business decisions were made using “gut feeling” while ignoring the available data. When Robert Nardelli became CEO of the company in 2000, he decided to change its culture starting with centralizing many of the decisions that were previously left to individual stores. This initiative met with substantial resistance, and many high-level employees left during Nardelli’s first year. Despite getting financial results such as doubling the sales of the company, many of the changes he made were criticized. He left the company in January 2007.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn08_025">Charan, R. (2006, April).

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch08_s02_s02_p04">A strong culture may also be a liability during a merger. During mergers and acquisitions, companies inevitably experience a clash of cultures, as well as a clash of structures and operating systems. Culture clash becomes more problematic if both parties have unique and strong cultures. For example, during the merger of Daimler-Benz with Chrysler to create DaimlerChrysler, the differing strong cultures of each company acted as a barrier to effective integration. Daimler had a strong engineering culture that was more hierarchical and emphasized routinely working long hours. Daimler employees were used to being part of an elite organization, evidenced by flying first class on all business trips. However, Chrysler had a sales culture where employees and managers were used to autonomy, working shorter hours, and adhering to budget limits that meant only the elite flew first class. The different ways of thinking and behaving in these two companies introduced a number of unanticipated problems during the integration process.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn08_026">Badrtalei, J., &amp; Bates, D.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch08_s02_s03_p01">So far, we have assumed that a company has a single culture that is shared throughout the organization. In reality there might be multiple cultures within the organization. For example, people working on the sales floor may experience a different culture from that experienced by people working in the warehouse. Cultures that emerge within different departments, branches, or geographic locations are called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">subcultures</a><span class="glossdef">A set of values unique to a limited cross section of the organization.</span></span>. Subcultures may arise from the personal characteristics of employees and managers, as well as the different conditions under which work is performed. In addition to understanding the broader organization’s values, managers will need to make an effort to understand subculture values to see their effect on workforce behavior and attitudes.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch08_s02_s03_p02">Sometimes, a subculture may take the form of a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">counterculture</a><span class="glossdef">Shared values and beliefs that are in direct opposition to the values of the broader organizational culture.</span></span>. Defined as shared values and beliefs that are in direct opposition to the values of the broader organizational culture,<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn08_027">Kerr, J., &amp; Slocum, J. W., Jr. (2005). Managing corporate culture through reward systems<em class="emphasis">. Academy of Management Executive, 19</em>, 130–138.</span> countercultures are often shaped around a charismatic leader. For example, within a largely bureaucratic organization, an enclave of innovativeness and risk taking may emerge within a single department. A counterculture may be tolerated by the organization as long as it is bringing in results and contributing positively to the effectiveness of the organization. However, its existence may be perceived as a threat to the broader organizational culture. In some cases, this may lead to actions that would take away the autonomy of the managers and eliminate the counterculture.</p>
