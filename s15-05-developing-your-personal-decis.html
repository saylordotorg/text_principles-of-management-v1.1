        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch11_s04_s01_p01">Doctors routinely perform postmortems to understand what went wrong with a patient who has died. The idea is for everyone to learn from the unfortunate outcome so that future patients will not meet a similar fate. But, what if you could avoid a horrible outcome before it happened by identifying project risks proactively—before your project derails? Research suggests that the simple exercise of imagining what could go wrong with a given decision can increase your ability to identify reasons for future successes or failures by 30%.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn11_038">Mitchell, D. J., Russo, J., &amp; Pennington, N. (1989). Back to the future: Temporal perspective in the explanation of events. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Behaviorial Decision Making, 2</em>, 25–38.</span> A “premortem” is a way to imagine and to avoid what might go wrong before spending a cent or having to change course along the way.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn11_039">Breen, B.

            <li>A planning team comes up with an outline of a plan, such as the launching of a new product.</li>
            <li>Either the existing group or a unique group is then told to imagine looking into a crystal ball and seeing that the new product failed miserably. They then write down all the reasons they can imagine that might have led to this failure.</li>
            <li>Each team member shares items from their list until all the potential problems have been identified.</li>
            <li>The list is reviewed for additional ideas.</li>
            <li>The issues are sorted into categories in the search for themes.</li>
            <li>The plan should then be revised to correct the flaws and avoid these potential problems.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch11_s04_s01_p03">The premortem technique allows groups to truly delve into “what if” scenarios. For example, in a premortem session at a <em class="emphasis">Fortune</em> 50 company, an executive imagined that a potential billion-dollar environmental sustainability project might fail because the CEO had retired.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Key Takeaway</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-127512-ch11_s04_s01_p04">There are a number of ways to learn about decision making that can help make you more effective. If the decision is important, conduct a premortem to anticipate what might go wrong. When a decision is going to involve others, be proactive in getting them to buy in before the decision is made. Individuals and groups can suffer from decision-making traps and process losses. Understanding that you can spot and avoid these traps is important in helping to make you a more effective manager.</p>
