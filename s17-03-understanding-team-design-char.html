    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch13_s02_p01">Effective teams give companies a significant competitive advantage. In a high-functioning team, the sum is truly greater than the parts. Team members not only benefit from one another’s diverse experiences and perspectives but also stimulate each other’s creativity. Plus, for many people, working in a team can be more fun than working alone. Let’s take a closer look at what a team is, the different team characteristics, types of teams companies use, and how to design effective teams.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Differences Between Groups and Teams</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch13_s02_s01_p01">Organizations consist of groups of people. What exactly is the difference between a group and a team? A group is a collection of individuals. Within an organization, groups might consist of project-related groups such as a product group or division or they can encompass an entire store or branch of a company. The performance of a group consists of the inputs of the group minus any process losses such as the quality of a product, ramp-up time to production, or the sales for a given month. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Process loss</a><span class="glossdef">Any aspect of group interaction that inhibits group functioning.</span></span> is any aspect of group interaction that inhibits group functioning.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch13_s02_s01_p02">Why do we say <em class="emphasis">group</em> instead of <em class="emphasis">team</em>? A collection of people is not a team, though they may learn to function in that way. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">team</a><span class="glossdef">A cohesive coalition of people working together to achieve mutual goals.</span></span> is a particular type of group: a cohesive coalition of people working together to achieve mutual goals. Being on a team does not equate to a total suppression of personal agendas, but it does require a commitment to the vision and involves each individual working toward accomplishing the team’s objective. Teams differ from other types of groups in that members are focused on a joint goal or product, such as a presentation, discussing a topic, writing a report, creating a new design or prototype, or winning a team Olympic medal. Moreover, teams also tend to be defined by their relatively smaller size. For instance, according to one definition, “A team is a <em class="emphasis">small</em> number of people with complementary skills who are committed to a common purpose, performance goals, and approach for which they are mutually accountable.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn13_013">Katzenbach, J.

            <p class="para">Teams are only as good as their weakest link. While Michael Phelps has been dubbed “the world’s greatest swimmer” and received a great deal of personal attention, such as meeting President George W. Bush, he could not have achieved his record eight gold medals in one Olympic games without the help of his teammates Aaron Peirsol, Brendan Hansen, and Jason Lezak.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch13_s02_s01_p03">The purpose of assembling a team is to accomplish larger, more complex goals than what would be possible for an individual working alone or even the simple sum of several individuals working independently. Teamwork is also needed in cases where multiple skills are tapped or where buy-in is required from several individuals. Teams can, but do not always, provide improved performance. Working together to further a team agenda seems to increase mutual cooperation between what are often competing factions. The aim and purpose of a team is to perform, get results, and achieve victory in the workplace. The best managers are those who can gather together a group of individuals and mold them into an effective team.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch13_s02_s01_p04">The key properties of a true team include <strong class="emphasis bold">collaborative action</strong> where, along with a common goal, teams have collaborative tasks. Conversely, in a group, individuals are responsible only for their own area. They also share the rewards of strong team performance with their <strong class="emphasis bold">compensation based on shared outcomes</strong>. Compensation of individuals must be based primarily on a shared outcome, not individual performance. Members are also willing to <strong class="emphasis bold">sacrifice for the common good</strong> in which individuals give up scarce resources for the common good instead of competing for those resources. For example, teams occur in sports such as soccer and basketball, in which the individuals actively help each other, forgo their own chance to score by passing the ball, and win or lose collectively as a team.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Teams in Organizations</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch13_s02_s02_p01">The early 1990s saw a dramatic rise in the use of teams within organizations, along with dramatic results such as the Miller Brewing Company increasing productivity 30% in the plants that used self-directed teams compared with those that used the traditional organization. This same method allowed Texas Instruments in Malaysia to reduce defects from 100 parts per million to 20 parts per million. In addition, Westinghouse reduced its cycle time from 12 weeks to 2 weeks, and Harris Electronics was able to achieve an 18% reduction in costs.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn13_014">Welins, R., Byham, W., &amp; Dixon, G. (1994). <em class="emphasis">Inside Teams</em>. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.</span> The team method has served countless companies over the years through both quantifiable improvements and more subtle individual worker-related benefits.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch13_s02_s02_p02">Companies such as Square D, a maker of circuit breakers, switched to self-directed teams and found that overtime on machines like the punch press dropped 70% under teams. Productivity increased because the setup operators were able to manipulate the work in much more effective ways than a supervisor could dictate.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn13_015">Moskal, B. (1988, June 20). Supervisors, begone! <em class="emphasis">Industry Week</em>, p. 32.</span> In 2001, clothing retailer Chico’s FAS was looking to grow its business. The company hired Scott Edmonds as president, and two years later revenues had almost doubled from $378 million to $760 million. By 2006, revenues were $1.6 billion, and Chico’s had nine years of double-digit same-store sales growth. What did Edmonds do to get these results? He created a horizontal organization “ruled by high-performance teams with real decision-making clout and accountability for results, rather than by committees that pass decisions up to the next level or toss them over the wall into the nearest silo.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch13_s02_s02_p03">The use of teams also began to increase because advances in technology have resulted in more complex systems that require contributions from multiple people across the organization. Overall, team-based organizations have more motivation and involvement, and teams can often accomplish more than individuals.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn13_016">Cannon-Bowers, J. A. and Salas, E. (2001, February). Team effectiveness and competencies. In W. Karwowski (Ed.), <em class="emphasis">International encyclopedia of ergonomics and human factors</em> (1383).

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch13_s02_s02_s01_p01">Teams are not a cure-all for organizations. To determine whether a team is needed, organizations should consider whether a variety of knowledge, skills, and abilities are needed, whether ideas and feedback are needed from different groups within the organization, how interdependent the tasks are, if wide cooperation is needed to get things done, and whether the organization would benefit from shared goals.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn13_017">Rees, F. (1997). <em class="emphasis">Teamwork from start to finish</em>. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.</span> If the answer to these questions is “yes,” then a team or teams might make sense. For example, research shows that the more team members perceive that outcomes are interdependent, the better they share information and the better they perform.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn13_018">De Dreu, C.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch13_s02_s03_s01_p01">Another key to understanding how tasks are related to teams is to understand their level of task interdependence. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Task interdependence</a><span class="glossdef">The degree that team members depend on one another to get information, support, or materials from other team members to be effective.</span></span> refers to the degree that team members depend on one another to get information, support, or materials from other team members to be effective.

For example, when students meet to divide the sections of a research paper and one person simply puts all the sections together to create one paper, the team is using the pooled interdependence model. However, they might decide that it makes more sense to start with one person writing the introduction of their research paper, then the second person reads what was written by the first person and, drawing from this section, writes about the findings within the paper. Using the findings section, the third person writes the conclusions.

The <strong class="emphasis bold">contributor role</strong> is important because it brings information and expertise to the team.

A company that sells products around the world, for example, may need technologists who can solve customer problems at any hour of the day or night. It may be difficult to find the caliber of people needed who would be willing to work at 2 a.m. on a Saturday, for example. So companies organize virtual technical support teams. BakBone Software, for instance, has a 13-member technical support team. Each member has a degree in computer science and is divided among offices in California, Maryland, England, and Tokyo. BakBone believes it has been able to hire stronger candidates by drawing from a diverse talent pool and hiring in different geographic regions rather than limiting hiring to one region or time zone.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn13_029">Alexander, S.

Managers often think that they have to see team members working to believe that work is being done. Because this kind of oversight is impossible in virtual team situations, it is important to devise evaluation schemes that focus on deliverables. Are team members delivering what they said they would? In self-managed teams, are team members producing the results the team decided to measure itself on?</p>

There are no formal rules about top management team design or structure. The top management team often includes representatives from functional areas, such as finance, human resources, and marketing or key geographic areas, such as Europe, Asia, and North America. Depending on the company, other areas may be represented such as legal counsel or the company’s chief technologist. Typical top management team member titles include chief operating officer (COO), chief financial officer (CFO), chief marketing officer (CMO), or chief technology officer (CTO). Because CEOs spend an increasing amount of time outside their companies (i.e., with suppliers, customers, regulators, and so on), the role of the COO has taken on a much higher level of internal operating responsibilities. In most American companies, the CEO also serves as chairman of the board and can have the additional title of president. Companies have top management teams to help set the company’s vision and strategic direction, key tasks within the planning P-O-L-C function. Top teams make decisions on new markets, expansions, acquisitions, or divestitures. The top team is also important for its symbolic role: how the top team behaves dictates the organization’s culture and priorities by allocating resources and by modeling behaviors that will likely be emulated lower down in the organization. Importantly, the top team is most effective when team composition is functionally and demographically diverse and when it can truly operate as a <em class="emphasis">team</em>, not just as <em class="emphasis">group</em> of individual executives.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn13_034">Carpenter, M.

Unlike manager-led teams, these teams manage themselves and do not report directly to a supervisor. Instead, team members select their own leader, and they may even take turns in the leadership role. Self-managed teams also have the power to select new team members. As a whole, the team shares responsibility for a significant task, such as assembly of an entire car. The task is ongoing rather than temporary such as a charity fund drive for a given year.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch13_s02_s05_p03">Organizations began to use self-managed teams as a way to reduce hierarchy by allowing team members to complete tasks and solve problems on their own. The benefits of self-managed teams extend much further. Research has shown that employees in self-managed teams have higher job satisfaction, increased self-esteem, and grow more on the job. The benefits to the organization include increased productivity, increased flexibility, and lower turnover. Self-managed teams can be found at all levels of the organization, and they bring particular benefits to lower-level employees by giving them a sense of ownership of their jobs that they may not otherwise have. The increased satisfaction can also reduce absenteeism because employees do not want to let their team members down.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch13_s02_s05_p04">Typical team goals are improving quality, reducing costs, and meeting deadlines. Teams also have a “stretch” goal, which is difficult to reach but important to the business unit. Many teams also have special project goals. Texas Instruments (TI), a company that makes semiconductors, used self-directed teams to make improvements in work processes.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn13_036">Welins, R., Byham, W., &amp; Dixon, G. (1994). <em class="emphasis">Inside teams</em>. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.</span> Teams were allowed to set their own goals in conjunction with managers and other teams. TI also added an individual component to the typical team compensation system. This individual component rewarded team members for learning new skills that added to their knowledge. These “knowledge blocks” include topics such as leadership, administration, and problem solving. The team decides what additional skills people might need to help the team meet its objectives. Team members would then take classes or otherwise demonstrate their proficiency in that new skill on the job to be certified for mastering the skill. Individuals could then be evaluated based on their contribution to the team and how they are building skills to support the team.</p>

They have a clearer understanding of others’ roles and greater accountability to fulfill their roles (remember social loafing?). Some tasks, however, require larger team sizes because of the need for diverse skills or because of the complexity of the task. In those cases, the best solution is to create subteams where one member from each subteam is a member of a larger coordinating team.

A team is a particular type of group: a cohesive coalition of people working together to achieve mutual goals. In the 21st century, many companies have moved toward the extensive use of teams. The task a team is charged with accomplishing affects how they perform. In general, task interdependence works well for self-managing teams. Team roles consist of task, social, and boundary-spanning roles. Different types of teams include task forces, product development teams, cross-functional teams, and top management teams. Team leadership and autonomy varies depending on whether the team is traditionally managed, self-managed, or self-directed. Teams are most effective when teams consist of members with the right KSAs for the tasks, are not too large, contain diversity across team members. Decisions about where and how to use teams, the leadership of teams, and the structure of teams illustrate the overlap in the design and leading P-O-L-C functions.</p>
