        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch13_s05_s01_p01">There are several steps you can take as a manager to help build a cohesive team. For example, you can work to:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch13_s05_s01_l01">
            <li>Align the group with the greater organization. Establish common objectives in which members can get involved.</li>
            <li>Let members have choices in setting their own goals. Include them in decision making at the organizational level.</li>
            <li>Define clear roles. Demonstrate how each person’s contribution furthers the group goal—everyone is responsible for a special piece of the puzzle.</li>
            <li>Situate group members in proximity to one another. This builds familiarity.</li>
            <li>Give frequent praise, both to individuals and to the group, and encourage them to praise each other. This builds individual self-confidence, reaffirms positive behavior, and creates an overall positive atmosphere.</li>
            <li>Treat all members with dignity and respect. This demonstrates that there are no favorites and everyone is valued.</li>
            <li>Celebrate differences. This highlights each individual’s contribution while also making diversity a norm.</li>
            <li>Establish common rituals. Thursday morning coffee, monthly potlucks—these reaffirm group identity and create shared experiences.</li>
        </ul>

            <h3 class="title">Key Takeaway</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-127512-ch13_s05_s01_p02">There are many things you can do to help build a cohesive team. One key thing to remember is that too much cohesion without strong performance norms can be a problem. Many of the ways to build cohesive groups are also fun, such as celebrating successes and creating rituals.</p>
