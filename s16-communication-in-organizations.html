<span class="title-prefix">12.1</span> Case in Point: Edward Jones Communicates Caring</h2>
    <div class="callout block" id="fwk-127512-12cases_n01">

        <p class="para" id="fwk-127512-12cases_p01">Because of the economic turmoil that most financial institutions find themselves in today, it might come as a surprise that an individual investment company came in at number 2 on <em class="emphasis">Fortune</em> magazine’s “100 Best Companies to Work For” list in 2010, behind software giant SAS Institute Inc. Edward Jones Investments (a limited partnership company) was originally founded in St. Louis, Missouri, where its headquarters remain today. With more than 10,000 offices across the United States and Canada, they are able to serve nearly 7 million investors. This is the 10th year Edward Jones has made the Best Companies list. In addition, Edward Jones ranked highest with client satisfaction among full-service investment firms, according to an annual survey released by J. D. Power and Associates in 2009. How has Edward Jones maintained this favorable reputation in the eyes of both its employees and its customers?</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-127512-12cases_p02">It begins with the perks offered, including profit sharing and telecommuting. But if you ask the company’s CEO, Tim Kirley, he will likely tell you that it goes beyond the financial incentives, and at the heart of it is the culture of honest communication that he adamantly promotes. Kirley works with senior managers and team members in what makes up an open floor plan and always tries to maintain his approachability. Examples of this include direct communication, letters to staff and video, and Internet-posted talks. In addition, regular meetings are held to celebrate achievements and reinforce the firm’s ethos. Staff surveys are frequently administered and feedback is widely taken into consideration so that the 10,000 employees feel heard and respected.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-127512-12cases_p03">According to <em class="emphasis">Fortune</em>’s managing editor, Hank Gilman, “The most important considerations for this year’s list were hiring and the ways in which companies are helping their employees weather the recession.” Edward Jones was able to persevere through the trauma of the recent financial crisis with no layoffs and an 8% one-year job growth. While a salary freeze was enacted, profit sharing continued. Kirley insists that the best approach to the recent economic downturn is to remain honest with his employees even when the news he is delivering is not what they want to hear.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-127512-12cases_p04">Edward Jones was established in 1922 by Edward D. Jones Sr., and long ago, the company recognized the importance of a satisfied workforce and how that has the ability to translate into customer satisfaction and long-term growth. The company’s internal policy of open communication seems to carry over to how advisors value their relationship with individual customers. Investors are most likely to contact their advisor by directly visiting them at a local branch or by picking up the phone and calling them. Edward Jones’s managing partner, Jim Weddle, explains it best himself: “We are able to stay focused on the long-term because we are a partnership and we know who we are and what we do. When you respect the people who work here, you take care of them—not just in the good times, but in the difficult times as well.”</p>

The ability to effectively communicate is a necessary condition for successfully planning, organizing, leading, and controlling.

It is defined in the <em class="emphasis">Merriam-Webster’s</em> dictionary as “a process by which information is exchanged between individuals through a common system of symbols, signs, or behavior.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn12_001"><em class="emphasis">Merriam-Webster online dictionary</em>.

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch12_s01_p02">So, just how prevalent is the problem of miscommunication in the workplace? You may be surprised to learn that the relationship between miscommunication and negative outcomes is strong.

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch12_s01_p03">Poor communication can also lead to lawsuits. For example, you might think that malpractice suits are filed against doctors based on the outcome of their treatments alone. But a 1997 study of malpractice suits found that a primary influence on whether a doctor is sued is that doctor’s communication style. While the combination of a bad outcome and patient unhappiness can quickly lead to litigation, a warm, personal communication style leads to greater patient satisfaction. And satisfied patients are less likely to sue.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn12_005">Communications skills cut malpractice risk—study reveals most important reason that patients decide to file malpractice suits is because of poor communication by physicians and not medical errors.

Failure to Communicate Costly for Companies. <em class="emphasis">USA Today</em>, 1A.</span> In contrast, effective communication is an asset for organizations and individuals alike.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch12_s01_s01_p01">Communication fulfills three main functions within an organization: (1) transmitting information, (2) coordinating effort, and (3) sharing emotions and feelings. All these functions are vital to a successful organization. Transmitting information is vital to an organization’s ability to function. Coordinating effort within the organization helps people work toward the same goals. Sharing emotions and feelings bonds teams and unites people in times of celebration and crisis. Effective communication helps people grasp issues, build rapport with coworkers, and achieve consensus. So, how can we communicate effectively? The first step is to understand the communication process.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch12_s01_s01_p02">We all exchange information with others countless times a day, by phone, e-mail, printed word, and of course, in person.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch12_s02_s01_s01_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Filtering</a><span class="glossdef">The distortion or withholding of information to manage a person’s reactions.</span></span> is the distortion or withholding of information to manage a person’s reactions. Some examples of filtering include a manager who keeps her division’s poor sales figures from her boss, the vice president, fearing that the bad news will make him angry. The old saying, “Don’t shoot the messenger!” illustrates the tendency of Receivers (in this case, the vice president) to vent their negative response to unwanted Messages on the Sender. A gatekeeper (the vice president’s assistant, perhaps) who doesn’t pass along a complete Message is also filtering. The vice president may delete the e-mail announcing the quarter’s sales figures before reading it, blocking the Message before it arrives.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch12_s02_s01_s01_p02">As you can see, filtering prevents members of an organization from getting a complete picture of the way things are. To maximize your chances of sending and receiving effective communications, it’s helpful to deliver a Message in multiple ways and to seek information from multiple sources. In this way, the effect of any one person’s filtering the Message will be diminished.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch12_s02_s01_s01_p03">Since people tend to filter bad news more during upward communication, it is also helpful to remember that those below you in an organization may be wary of sharing bad news. One way to defuse the tendency to filter is to reward employees who clearly convey information upward, regardless of whether the news is good and bad.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch12_s02_s01_s01_p04">Here are some of the criteria that individuals may use when deciding whether to filter a Message or pass it on:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch12_s02_s01_s01_l01">
                <li>Past experience: Was the Sender rewarded for passing along news of this kind in the past, or was she criticized?</li>
                <li>Knowledge, perception of the speaker: Has the Receiver’s direct superior made it clear that “no news is good news?”</li>
                <li>Emotional state, involvement with the topic, level of attention: Does the Sender’s fear of failure or criticism prevent him from conveying the Message? Is the topic within his realm of expertise, increasing his confidence in his ability to decode it, or is he out of his comfort zone when it comes to evaluating the Message’s significance? Are personal concerns impacting his ability to judge the Message’s value?</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch12_s02_s01_s01_p05">Once again, filtering can lead to miscommunications in business.

Since Bill found his boss’s to-do list to be unreasonably demanding, he assumed the request could wait. (How else could he do everything else on the list?) The boss, assuming that Bill had heard the urgency in her request, assumed that Bill would place the order before returning to the other tasks on her list.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch12_s02_s01_s02_p03">Both members of this organization were using selective perception to evaluate the communication.

While he’s talking, he hears the chime of e-mail alerting him to an important message from his boss. He’s scanning through it quickly, while still on the phone, when a coworker pokes his head around the cubicle corner to remind Bill that he’s late for a staff meeting. The supplier on the other end of the phone line has just given Bill a choice among the products and delivery dates he requested. Bill realizes he missed hearing the first two options, but he doesn’t have time to ask the supplier to repeat them all or to try reconnecting to place the order at a later time. He chooses the third option—at least he heard that one, he reasons, and it seemed fair. How good was Bill’s decision amid all the information he was processing at the same time?</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch12_s02_s01_s04_p01"><strong class="emphasis bold">Emotional disconnects</strong> happen when the Sender or the Receiver is upset, whether about the subject at hand or about some unrelated incident that may have happened earlier. An effective communication requires a Sender and a Receiver who are open to speaking and listening to one another, despite possible differences in opinion or personality. One or both parties may have to put their emotions aside to achieve the goal of communicating clearly. A Receiver who is emotionally upset tends to ignore or distort what the Sender is saying. A Sender who is emotionally upset may be unable to present ideas or feelings effectively.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch12_s02_s01_s05_p01"><strong class="emphasis bold">Lack of source familiarity or credibility</strong> can derail communications, especially when humor is involved. Have you ever told a joke that fell flat? You and the Receiver lacked the common context that could have made it funny. (Or yes, it could have just been a lousy joke.) Sarcasm and irony are subtle, and potentially hurtful, commodities in business. It’s best to keep these types of communications out of the workplace as their benefits are limited, and their potential dangers are great. Lack of familiarity with the Sender can lead to misinterpreting humor, especially in less-rich information channels like e-mail. For example, an e-mail from Jill that ends with, “Men, like hens, should boil in vats of oil,” could be interpreted as antimale if the Receiver didn’t know that Jill has a penchant for rhyme and likes to entertain coworkers by making up amusing sayings.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch12_s02_s01_s05_p02">Similarly, if the Sender lacks credibility or is untrustworthy, the Message will not get through.

Likewise, if the Sender has communicated erroneous information in the past, or has created false emergencies, his current Message may be filtered.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch12_s02_s01_s05_p05">Some downsides of the office grapevine are that gossip offers politically minded insiders a powerful tool for disseminating communication (and self-promoting miscommunications) within an organization. In addition, the grapevine lacks a specific Sender, which can create a sense of distrust among employees—who is at the root of the gossip network? When the news is volatile, suspicions may arise as to the person or persons behind the Message. Managers who understand the grapevine’s power can use it to send and receive Messages of their own. They also decrease the grapevine’s power by sending official Messages quickly and accurately, should big news arise.</p>

Words can mean different things to different people, or they might not mean anything to another person. For example, companies often have their own acronyms and buzzwords (called business jargon) that are clear to them but impenetrable to outsiders. For example, at IBM, GBS is focusing on BPTS, using expertise acquired from the PwC purchase (which had to be sold to avoid conflicts of interest in light of SOX) to fend other BPO providers and inroads by the Bangalore tiger. Does this make sense to you? If not, here’s the translation: IBM’s Global Business Services (GBS) division is focusing on offering companies Business Process Transformation Services (BPTS), using the expertise it acquired from purchasing the management consulting and technology services arm of PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), which had to sell the division because of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX, enacted in response to the major accounting scandals like the Enron). The added management expertise puts it above business process outsourcing (BPO) vendors who focus more on automating processes rather than transforming and improving them.

For example, an information technology (IT) systems analyst communicating with another IT employee may use jargon as a way of sharing information in a way that reinforces the pair’s shared knowledge.

But in business, what do those words mean? Different words mean different things to different people. Age, education, and cultural background are all factors that influence how a person interprets words. The less we consider our audience, the greater our chances of miscommunication will be. When communication occurs in the cross-cultural context, extra caution is needed given that different words will be interpreted differently across cultures and different cultures have different norms regarding nonverbal communication. Eliminating jargon is one way of ensuring that our words will convey real-world concepts to others. Speaking to our audience, as opposed to about ourselves, is another. Nonverbal Messages can also have different meanings.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch12_s02_s02_p01">Former Chrysler CEO Lee Iacocca lamented, “I only wish I could find an institute that teaches people how to listen. After all, a good manager needs to listen at least as much as he needs to talk.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn12_022">Iacocca, L., &amp; Novak, W.

(1989). Listening, communication abilities, and success at work. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Business Communication</em>, <em class="emphasis">26</em>, 293–303.</span> A Sender may strive to deliver a Message clearly. But the Receiver’s ability to listen effectively is equally vital to effective communication. The average worker spends 55% of her workdays listening. Managers listen up to 70% each day. But listening doesn’t lead to understanding in every case. Listening takes practice, skill, and concentration.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch12_s02_s02_p02">According to University of San Diego professor Phillip Hunsaker, “The consequences of poor listening are lower employee productivity, missed sales, unhappy customers, and billions of dollars of increased cost and lost profits. Poor listening is a factor in low employee morale and increased turnover because employees do not feel their managers listen to their needs, suggestions, or complaints.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn12_024">Alessandra, T., Garner, H., &amp; Hunsaker, P. L. (1993). <em class="emphasis">Communicating at work</em>.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch12_s02_s02_p03">Alan Gulick, a Starbucks spokesperson, puts better listening to work in pursuit of better profits. If every Starbucks employee misheard one $10 order each day, he calculates, their errors would cost the company a billion dollars annually. To teach its employees to listen, Starbucks created a code that helps employees taking orders hear the size, flavor, and use of milk or decaf coffee. The person making the drink echoes the order aloud.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch12_s02_s02_p04">How can you improve your listening skills? The Roman philosopher Cicero said, “Silence is one of the great arts of conversation.” How often have we been in conversation with someone else where we are not really listening but itching to convey our portion? This behavior is known as “rehearsing.” It suggests the Receiver has no intention of considering the Sender’s Message and intends to respond to an earlier point instead. Clearly, rehearsing is an impediment to the communication process. Effective communication relies on another kind of listening: active listening.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch12_s02_s02_p05"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Active listening</a><span class="glossdef">Giving full attention to what other people are saying.</span></span> can be defined as giving full attention to what other people are saying, taking time to understand the points being made, asking questions as appropriate, and not interrupting at inappropriate times.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn12_025">O*NET Resource Center, the nation’s primary source of occupational information. Retrieved July 2, 2008, from <a class="link" href="http://online.onetcenter.org/skills">http://online.onetcenter.org/skills</a>.</span>Active listening creates a real-time relationship between the Sender and the Receiver by acknowledging the content and receipt of a Message. As we’ve seen in the Starbucks example, repeating and confirming a Message’s content offers a way to confirm that the correct content is flowing between colleagues. The process creates a bond between coworkers while increasing the flow and accuracy of messaging.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch12_s02_s02_p06">Carl Rogers, founder of the “person-centered” approach to psychology, formulated five rules for active listening:</p>

            <li>Note all cues</li>
            <li>Paraphrase and restate</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch12_s02_s02_p07">The good news is that listening is a skill that can be learned.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn12_026">Brownell, J. (1990). Perceptions of effective listeners: A management study. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Business Communications</em>, <em class="emphasis">27</em>, 401–415.</span> The first step is to decide that we want to listen. Casting aside distractions, such as by reducing background or internal noise, is critical. The Receiver takes in the Sender’s Message silently, without speaking. Second, throughout the conversation, show the speaker that you’re listening. You can do this nonverbally by nodding your head and keeping your attention focused on the speaker. You can also do it verbally, by saying things like, “Yes,” “That’s interesting,” or other such verbal cues. As you’re listening, pay attention to the Sender’s body language for additional cues about how they’re feeling. Interestingly, silence plays a major role in active listening. During active listening, we are trying to understand what has been said, and in silence, we can consider the implications. We can’t consider information and reply to it at the same time. That’s where the power of silence comes into play. Finally, if anything is not clear to you, ask questions. Confirm that you’ve heard the message accurately, by repeating back a crucial piece like, “Great, I’ll see you at 2 p.m. in my office.” At the end of the conversation, a “thank you” from both parties is an optional but highly effective way of acknowledging each other’s teamwork.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch12_s02_s02_p08">In summary, active listening creates a more dynamic relationship between a Receiver and a Sender. It strengthens personal investment in the information being shared. It also forges healthy working relationships among colleagues by making Speakers and Listeners equally valued members of the communication process.</p>

            <p class="para" id="fwk-127512-ch12_s02_s02_p09">Many barriers to effective communication exist. Examples include filtering, selective perception, information overload, emotional disconnects, lack of source familiarity or credibility, workplace gossip, semantics, gender differences, differences in meaning between Sender and Receiver, and biased language. The Receiver can enhance the probability of effective communication by engaging in active listening, which involves (1) giving one’s full attention to the Sender and (2) checking for understanding by repeating the essence of the Message back to the Sender.</p>

Examples of written communications include memos, proposals, e-mails, letters, training manuals, and operating policies. They may be printed on paper, handwritten, or appear on the screen. Normally, a verbal communication takes place in real time. Written communication, by contrast, can be constructed over a longer period of time. Written communication is often asynchronous (occurring at different times). That is, the Sender can write a Message that the Receiver can read at any time, unlike a conversation that is carried on in real time. A written communication can also be read by many people (such as all employees in a department or all customers). It’s a “one-to-many” communication, as opposed to a one-to-one verbal conversation. There are exceptions, of course: a voicemail is an oral Message that is asynchronous. Conference calls and speeches are oral one-to-many communications, and e-mails may have only one recipient or many.</p>

Thomas Jefferson summed up the rules of writing well with this idea “Don’t use two words when one will do.” One of the oldest myths in business is that writing more will make us sound more important; in fact, the opposite is true. Leaders who can communicate simply and clearly project a stronger image than those who write a lot but say nothing.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Nonverbal Communication</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch12_s03_s03_p01">What you say is a vital part of any communication. But what you <em class="emphasis">don’t say</em> can be even more important. Research also shows that 55% of in-person communication comes from nonverbal cues like facial expressions, body stance, and tone of voice. According to one study, only 7% of a Receiver’s comprehension of a Message is based on the Sender’s actual words; 38% is based on paralanguage (the tone, pace, and volume of speech), and 55% is based on <em class="emphasis">nonverbal cues</em> (body language).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn12_031">Mehrabian, A. (1981). <em class="emphasis">Silent messages</em>. New York: Wadsworth.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch12_s03_s03_p02">Research shows that nonverbal cues can also affect whether you get a job offer. Judges examining videotapes of actual applicants were able to assess the social skills of job candidates with the sound turned off. They watched the rate of gesturing, time spent talking, and formality of dress to determine which candidates would be the most successful socially on the job.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn12_032">Gifford, R., Ng, C. F., &amp; Wilkinson, M. (1985). Nonverbal cues in the employment interview: Links between applicant qualities and interviewer judgments. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Applied Psychology</em>, <em class="emphasis">70</em>, 729–736.</span> For this reason, it is important to consider how we appear in business as well as what we say. The muscles of our faces convey our emotions. We can send a silent message without saying a word. A change in facial expression can change our emotional state. Before an interview, for example, if we focus on feeling confident, our face will convey that confidence to an interviewer. Adopting a smile (even if we’re feeling stressed) can reduce the body’s stress levels.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch12_s03_s03_p03">To be effective communicators, we need to align our body language, appearance, and tone with the words we’re trying to convey.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch12_s03_s03_p05">Another element of nonverbal communication is tone. A different tone can change the perceived meaning of a message. <a class="xref" href="#fwk-127512-ch12_s03_s03_t01">Table 12.2 "Don’t Use That Tone with Me!"</a> demonstrates how clearly this can be true, whether in verbal or written communication. If we simply read these words without the added emphasis, we would be left to wonder, but the emphasis shows us how the tone conveys a great deal of information. Now you can see how changing one’s tone of voice or writing can incite or defuse a misunderstanding.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch12_s03_s03_p06">For an example of the importance of nonverbal communication, imagine that you’re a customer interested in opening a new bank account. At one bank, the bank officer is dressed neatly. She looks you in the eye when she speaks. Her tone is friendly. Her words are easy to understand, yet she sounds professional. “Thank you for considering Bank of the East Coast. We appreciate this opportunity and would love to explore ways that we can work together to help your business grow,” she says with a friendly smile.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch12_s03_s03_p07">At the second bank, the bank officer’s tie is stained. He looks over your head and down at his desk as he speaks. He shifts in his seat and fidgets with his hands. His words say, “Thank you for considering Bank of the West Coast. We appreciate this opportunity and would love to explore ways that we can work together to help your business grow,” but he mumbles, and his voice conveys no enthusiasm or warmth.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch12_s03_s03_p09">The speaker’s body language must match his or her words. If a Sender’s words and body language don’t match—if a Sender smiles while telling a sad tale, for example—the mismatch between verbal and nonverbal cues can cause a Receiver to actively dislike the Sender.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch12_s03_s03_p10">Here are a few examples of nonverbal cues that can support or detract from a Sender’s Message.</p>

Happiness is associated with an upturned mouth and slightly closed eyes; fear with an open mouth and wide-eyed stare. Flitting (“shifty”) eyes and pursed lips convey a lack of trustworthiness.

Written communications have the advantage of asynchronicity, of reaching many readers, and are best for conveying information. Both verbal and written communications convey nonverbal messages through tone; verbal communications are also colored by body language, eye contact, facial expression, posture, touch, and space.</p>

Handheld devices, blogs, and written letters and memos offer medium-rich channels because they convey words and pictures/photos. Formal written documents, such as legal documents, and spreadsheets, such as the division’s budget, convey the least richness because the format is often rigid and standardized.

The employees appear interested. But how much information is being transmitted? Not as much as the speaker believes! Humans listen much faster than they speak. The average public speaker communicates at a speed of about 125 words a minute. And that pace sounds fine to the audience. (In fact, anything faster than that probably would sound weird. To put that figure in perspective, someone having an excited conversation speaks at about 150 words a minute.) On the basis of these numbers, we could assume that the employees have more than enough time to take in each word the manager delivers. And that’s the problem.

Oral communication, however, makes more sense when the Sender is conveying a sensitive or emotional Message, needs feedback immediately, and does not need a permanent record of the conversation.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch12_s04_s02_p03">An important, although often ignored, rule when communicating emotional information is that e-mail’s lack of richness can be your loss. As we saw in the chart above, e-mail is a medium-rich channel. It can convey facts quickly. But when it comes to emotion, e-mail’s flaws make it far less desirable a choice than oral communication—the 55% of nonverbal cues that make a conversation comprehensible to a listener are missing. E-mail readers don’t pick up on sarcasm and other tonal aspects of writing as much as the writer believes they will, researchers note in a recent study.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn12_043">Kruger, J.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch12_s04_s02_p04">The Sender may believe she has included these emotional signifiers in her Message. But, with words alone, those signifiers are not there. This gap between the form and content of e-mail inspired the rise of emoticons—symbols that offer clues to the emotional side of the words in each Message. Generally speaking, however, emoticons are not considered professional in business communication.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch12_s04_s02_p05">You might feel uncomfortable conveying an emotionally laden message verbally, especially when the message contains unwanted news. Sending an e-mail to your staff that there will be no bonuses this year may seem easier than breaking the bad news face-to-face, but that doesn’t mean that e-mail is an effective or appropriate way to deliver this kind of news. When the Message is emotional, the Sender should use verbal communication. Indeed, a good rule of thumb is that the more emotionally laden messages require more thought in the choice of channel and how they are communicated.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch12_s04_s03_p01">Information can move horizontally, from a Sender to a Receiver, as we’ve seen. It can also move vertically, down from top management or up from the front line. Information can also move diagonally between and among levels of an organization, such as a Message from a customer service representative up to a manager in the manufacturing department, or a Message from the chief financial officer sent down to all department heads.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch12_s04_s03_p02">There is a chance for these arrows to go awry, of course. As Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, author of best-selling books such as <em class="emphasis">Flow</em>, has noted, “In large organizations the dilution of information as it passes up and down the hierarchy, and horizontally across departments, can undermine the effort to focus on common goals.” Managers need to keep this in mind when they make organization design decisions as part of the organizing function.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch12_s04_s03_p03">The organizational status of the Sender can affect the Receiver’s attentiveness to the Message. For example, consider: A senior manager sends a memo to a production supervisor. The supervisor, who has a lower status within the organization, is likely to pay close attention to the Message. The same information, conveyed in the opposite direction, however, might not get the attention it deserves. The Message would be filtered by the senior manager’s perception of priorities and urgencies.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch12_s04_s03_p04">Requests are just one kind of communication in business.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch12_s04_s04_p01">External communications deliver specific business messages to individuals outside an organization. They may announce changes in staff or strategy, earnings, and more. The goal of an external communication is to create a specific Message that the Receiver will understand and share with others. Examples of external communications include the following:</p>
        <div class="section" id="fwk-127512-ch12_s04_s04_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Press Releases</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch12_s04_s04_s01_p01"><strong class="emphasis bold">Public relations</strong> professionals create external communications about a client’s product, services or practices for specific Receivers. These Receivers, it is hoped, will share the Message with others. In time, as the Message is passed along, it should <em class="emphasis">appear</em> to be independent of The Sender, creating the illusion of an independently generated consumer trend, public opinion, and so on.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch12_s04_s04_s01_p02">The Message of a public relations effort may be <em class="emphasis">b2b</em> (business to business), <em class="emphasis">b2c</em> (business to consumer), or media related. The Message can take different forms. Press releases try to convey a newsworthy message, real or manufactured. It may be constructed like a news item, inviting editors or reporters to reprint the Message in part, or as a whole, with or without acknowledgment of the Sender’s identity. Public relations campaigns create Messages over time, through contests, special events, trade shows, and media interviews in addition to press releases.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Ads</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch12_s04_s04_s02_p01">Advertising places external business Messages before target Receivers through media buys. A media buy is a fee that is paid to a television network, Web site, or magazine by an advertiser for an on-air, site, or publication ad. The fee is based on the perceived value of the audience who watches, reads, or frequents the space where the ad will appear.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch12_s04_s04_s02_p02">In recent years, Receivers have begun to filter advertiser’s Messages, a phenomenon that is perceived to be the result of the large amount of ads the average person sees each day and a growing level of consumer wariness of paid Messaging. Advertisers, in turn, are trying to create alternative forms of advertising that Receivers won’t filter. The <em class="emphasis">advertorial</em> is one example of an external communication that combines the look of an article with the focused Message of an ad. Product placements in videos, movies, and games are other ways that advertisers strive to reach Receivers with commercial Messages.</p>

        <div class="section" id="fwk-127512-ch12_s04_s04_s03">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Web Pages</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch12_s04_s04_s03_p01">A Web page’s external communication can combine elements of public relations, advertising, and editorial content, reaching Receivers on multiple levels and in multiple ways. Banner ads, blogs, and advertiser-driven “click-through” areas are just a few of the elements that allow a business to deliver a Message to a Receiver online. The perceived flexibility of online communications can impart a less formal (and, therefore, more believable) quality to an external communication. A Message relayed in a daily blog post will reach a Receiver differently than if it is delivered in an annual report, for example. The popularity and power of blogs is growing, with 11% of <em class="emphasis">Fortune</em> 500 companies having official blogs (up from 4% in 2005). In fact, blogs have become so important to some companies as Coca-Cola, Kodak, and Marriott that they have created official positions within their organizations titled “Chief Blogging Officer.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn12_046">Chief blogging officer title catching on with corporations.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch12_s04_s04_s03_p02">The “real-time” quality of Web communications may appeal to Receivers who might filter out a traditional ad and public relations message because of its “prefab” quality. Despite their “spontaneous” feel, many online pages can be revisited in perpetuity. For this reason, clear and accurate external communications are as vital for online use as they are in traditional media.</p>

The key to a successful external communication to customers is to convey a business message in a personally compelling way—dramatic news, a money-saving coupon, and so forth.</p>

        <ol class="orderedlist" id="fwk-127512-ch12_s05_l02">
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Start by stopping</em>. Take a moment to inhale and exhale quietly before you begin to listen. Your job as a listener is to receive information openly and accurately.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Don’t worry about what you’ll say when the time comes</em>. Silence can be a beautiful thing.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Join the Sender’s team</em>. When she pauses, summarize what you believe she has said. “What I’m hearing is that we need to focus on marketing as well as sales. Is that correct?” Be attentive to physical as well as verbal communications. “I hear you saying that we should focus on marketing. But the way you’re shaking your head tells me the idea may not really appeal to you—is that right?”</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Don’t multitask while listening</em>. Listening is a full-time job. It’s tempting to multitask when you and the Sender are in different places, but doing that is counterproductive. The human mind can only focus on one thing at a time. Listening with only half your brain increases the chances that you’ll have questions later, requiring more of the Speaker’s time. (And when the speaker is in the same room, multitasking signals a disinterest that is considered rude.)</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Try to empathize with the Sender’s point of view</em>. You don’t have to agree; but can you find common ground?</li>
            <li>Confused? <em class="emphasis">Ask questions</em>. There’s nothing wrong with admitting you haven’t understood the Sender’s point. You may even help the Sender clarify the Message.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Establish eye contact</em>. Making eye contact with the speaker (if appropriate for the culture) is important.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">What is the goal of this communication</em>? Ask yourself this question at different points during the communication to keep the information flow on track. Be polite. Differences in opinion can be the starting point of consensus.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">It’s great to be surprised</em>. Listen with an open mind, not just for what you <strong class="emphasis bold">want</strong> to hear.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Pay attention to what is not said</em>. Does the Sender’s body language seem to contradict her Message? If so, clarification may be in order.</li>

The typical convention for business e-mail contains some form of your name. While an e-mail name like “LazyGirl” or “DeathMonkey” may be fine for chatting online with your friends, they may send the wrong signal to individuals you e-mail such as professors and prospective employers.</p>
