    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch10_p02">Perhaps this is obvious, but leadership is the first of five facets constituting a manager’s leading function in the P-O-L-C framework. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Leadership</a><span class="glossdef">The act of influencing others toward a goal.</span></span> may be defined as the act of influencing others to work toward a goal. Leaders exist at all levels of an organization. Some leaders hold a position of authority and may use the power that comes from their position, as well as their personal power, to influence others; they are called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">formal leaders</a><span class="glossdef">Those who hold a position of authority and may utilize the power that comes from their position, as well as their personal power to influence others.</span></span>. In contrast, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">informal leaders</a><span class="glossdef">Those without a formal position of authority within the organization but demonstrate leadership by influencing those around them through personal forms of power.</span></span> are without a formal position of authority within the organization but demonstrate leadership by influencing others through personal forms of power. One caveat is important here: Leaders do not rely on the use of force to influence people. Instead, people willingly adopt the leader’s goal as their own goal. If a person is relying on force and punishment, the person is a dictator, not a leader.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch10_p03">What makes leaders effective? What distinguishes people who are perceived as leaders from those who are not perceived as leaders? More importantly, how do we train future leaders and improve their leadership ability? These are important questions that have attracted scholarly attention in the past several decades. In this chapter, we will review the history of leadership studies and summarize the major findings relating to these important questions. Around the world, we view leaders as at least partly responsible for their team’s or company’s success and failure. Company chief executive officers (CEOs) are paid millions of dollars in salaries and stock options with the assumption that they hold their company’s future in their hands. In politics, education, sports, and profit and nonprofit sectors, influence of leaders over the behaviors of individuals and organizations is rarely questioned. When people and organizations fail, managers and CEOs are often viewed as responsible. Some people criticize the assumption that leadership always matters and call this belief “the romance of leadership.” However, research evidence pointing to the importance of leaders for organizational success is accumulating.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn10_001">Hogan, R., Curphy, G.

                <p class="para">Source: Used by permission of PepsiCo Incorporated.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-127512-10cases_p01">She is among the top 100 most influential people according to <em class="emphasis">Time</em> magazine’s 2008 list. She has also ranked number 4 in <em class="emphasis">Forbes</em>’s “Most Influential Women in the World” (2010), number 1 in <em class="emphasis">Fortune</em>’s “50 Most Powerful Women” (2006 through 2009), and number 22 in <em class="emphasis">Fortune</em>’s “25 Most Powerful People in Business” (2007). The lists go on and on. To those familiar with her work and style, this should come as no surprise: Even before she became the CEO of PepsiCo Inc. (NYSE: PEP) in 2006, she was one of the most powerful executives at PepsiCo and one of the two candidates being groomed for the coveted CEO position. Born in Chennai, India, Nooyi graduated from Yale’s School of Management and worked in companies such as the Boston Consulting Group Inc., Motorola Inc., and ABB Inc. She also led an all-girls rock band in high school, but that is a different story.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-127512-10cases_p02">What makes her one of the top leaders in the business world today? To start with, she has a clear vision for PepsiCo, which seems to be the right vision for the company at this point in time. Her vision is framed under the term “performance with purpose,” which is based on two key ideas: tackling the obesity epidemic by improving the nutritional status of PepsiCo products and making PepsiCo an environmentally sustainable company. She is an inspirational speaker and rallies people around her vision for the company. She has the track record to show that she means what she says. She was instrumental in PepsiCo’s acquisition of the food conglomerate Quaker Oats Company and the juice maker Tropicana Products Inc., both of which have healthy product lines. She is bent on reducing PepsiCo’s reliance on high-sugar, high-calorie beverages, and she made sure that PepsiCo removed trans fats from all its products before its competitors. On the environmental side, she is striving for a net zero impact on the environment. Among her priorities are plans to reduce the plastic used in beverage bottles and find biodegradable packaging solutions for PepsiCo products. Her vision is long term and could be risky for short-term earnings, but it is also timely and important.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-127512-10cases_p03">Those who work with her feel challenged by her high-performance standards and expectation of excellence. She is not afraid to give people negative feedback—and with humor, too. She pushes people until they come up with a solution to a problem and does not take “I don’t know” for an answer. For example, she insisted that her team find an alternative to the expensive palm oil and did not stop urging them forward until the alternative arrived: rice bran oil.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-127512-10cases_p04">Nooyi is well liked and respected because she listens to those around her, even when they disagree with her. Her background cuts across national boundaries, which gives her a true appreciation for diversity, and she expects those around her to bring their values to work. In fact, when she graduated from college, she wore a sari to a job interview at Boston Consulting, where she got the job. She is an unusually collaborative person in the top suite of a <em class="emphasis">Fortune</em> 500 company, and she seeks help and information when she needs it. She has friendships with three ex-CEOs of PepsiCo who serve as her informal advisors, and when she was selected to the top position at PepsiCo, she made sure that her rival for the position got a pay raise and was given influence in the company so she did not lose him. She says that the best advice she received was from her father, who taught her to assume that people have good intentions. Nooyi notes that expecting people to have good intentions helps her prevent misunderstandings and show empathy for them. It seems that she is a role model to other business leaders around the world, and PepsiCo is well positioned to tackle the challenges the future may bring.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch10_s01_p01">The earliest approach to the study of leadership sought to identify a set of traits that distinguished leaders from nonleaders. What were the personality characteristics and physical and psychological attributes of people who are viewed as leaders? Because of the problems in measurement of personality traits at the time, different studies used different measures. By 1940, researchers concluded that the search for leadership-defining traits was futile. In recent years, though, after advances in personality literature such as the development of the Big Five personality framework, researchers have had more success in identifying traits that predict leadership.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn10_002">House, R.

The social scientific study of leadership: Quo Vadis? <em class="emphasis">Journal of Management, 23</em>, 409–473.</span> Most importantly, charismatic leadership, which is among the contemporary approaches to leadership, may be viewed as an example of a trait approach.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch10_s01_p02">The traits that show relatively strong relations with leadership are as follows:<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn10_003">Judge, T.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Intelligence</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch10_s01_s01_p01">General mental ability, which psychologists refer to as “g” and which is often called IQ in everyday language, has been related to a person’s emerging as a leader within a group. Specifically, people who have high mental abilities are more likely to be viewed as leaders in their environment.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn10_004">House, R. J., &amp; Aditya, R. N. (1997). The social scientific study of leadership: Quo Vadis? <em class="emphasis">Journal of Management, 23</em>, 409–473; Ilies, R., Gerhardt, M. W., &amp; Huy, L. (2004).

(1999). Leadership emergence in autonomous work teams: Antecedents and outcomes. <em class="emphasis">Personnel Psychology, 52</em>, 899–926.</span> We should caution, though, that intelligence is a positive but modest predictor of leadership. In addition to having high IQ, effective leaders tend to have high emotional intelligence (EQ). People with high EQ demonstrate a high level of self-awareness, motivation, empathy, and social skills. The psychologist who coined the term emotional intelligence, Daniel Goleman, believes that IQ is a threshold quality: it matters for entry- to high-level management jobs, but once you get there, it no longer helps leaders because most leaders already have high IQ. According to Goleman, what differentiates effective leaders from ineffective ones becomes their ability to control their own emotions and understand other people’s emotions, their internal motivation, and their social skills.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn10_005">Goleman, D.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch10_s01_s01_p02">Psychologists have proposed various systems for categorizing the characteristics that make up an individual’s unique personality; one of the most widely accepted is the Big Five model, which rates an individual according to openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and Neuroticism. Several of the Big Five personality traits have been related to leadership emergence (whether someone is viewed as a leader by others) and leadership effectiveness.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch10_s01_s01_p03">For example, extraversion is related to leadership. <em class="emphasis">extraverts</em> are sociable, assertive, and energetic people. They enjoy interacting with others in their environment and demonstrate self-confidence. Because they are both dominant and sociable in their environment, they emerge as leaders in a wide variety of situations. Out of all personality traits, extraversion has the strongest relationship to both leader emergence and leader effectiveness. Research shows that conscientious people are also more likely to be leaders. This is not to say that all effective leaders are extraverts, but you are more likely to find extraverts in leadership positions. An example of an introverted leader is Jim Buckmaster, the CEO of Craigslist. He is known as an introvert, and he admits to not having meetings because he does not like them.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn10_007">Buckmaster, Jim. (2008, May). How does he manage?

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch10_s01_s01_p04">Another personality trait related to leadership is <em class="emphasis">conscientiousness</em>. Conscientious people are organized, take initiative, and demonstrate persistence in their endeavors. Conscientious people are more likely to emerge as leaders and be effective as leaders. Finally, people who have <em class="emphasis">openness to experience</em>—those who demonstrate originality, creativity, and are open to trying new things—tend to emerge as leaders and tend to be effective as leaders.</p>

    <div class="section" id="fwk-127512-ch10_s01_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Self-Esteem</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch10_s01_s02_p01">Self-esteem is not one of the Big Five personality traits, but it is an important aspect of one’s personality. The degree to which people are at peace with themselves and have an overall positive assessment of their self-worth and capabilities seems to be relevant to whether they will be viewed as a leader. Leaders with high self-esteem support their subordinates more, and when punishment needs to be administered, they punish more effectively.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn10_008">Atwater, L. E., Dionne, S. D., Camobreco, J. F., Avolio, B. J., &amp; Lau, A. (1998).

Self-esteem: Relationship with leader behavior perceptions as moderated by the duration of the superior-subordinate dyad association, <em class="emphasis">Personality and Social Psychology Buletin</em>, <em class="emphasis">10</em>, 51–59.</span> It is possible that those with high self-esteem have greater levels of self-confidence and this affects their image in the eyes of their followers. Self-esteem may also explain the relationship between some physical attributes and emerging as a leader. For example, research shows a strong relationship between height and being viewed as a leader (as well as one’s career success over life). It is proposed that self-esteem may be the key to the connection of height with leadership, because people who are taller are also found to have higher self-esteem and therefore may project greater levels of charisma as well as confidence to their followers.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn10_009">Judge, T.

            <p class="para" id="fwk-127512-ch10_s01_s03_p03">Many studies searched for a limited set of personal attributes, or traits, which would make someone be viewed as a leader and be successful as a leader. Some traits are consistently related to leadership, such as intelligence (both mental ability and emotional intelligence), personality (extraversion, conscientiousness, openness to experience, self-esteem), and integrity. The main limitation of the trait approach was that it ignored the situation in which leadership occurred. Therefore, it is more useful to specify the conditions under which different traits are needed.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch10_s02_p01">When the trait researchers became disillusioned in 1940s, their attention turned to studying leader behaviors. What did effective leaders actually do? Which behaviors helped them to be perceived as leaders? Which behaviors increased their success?</p>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-127512-ch10_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Leader Behaviors</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch10_s02_s01_p01">In order to understand behaviors of effective leaders, researchers at Ohio State University and University of Michigan used many different techniques such as observing leaders in laboratory settings as well as surveying them. This research stream led to the discovery of two broad categories of behaviors: task-oriented behaviors (sometimes called <em class="emphasis">initiating structure</em>) and people-oriented behaviors (also called <em class="emphasis">consideration</em>). <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Task-oriented leader behaviors</a><span class="glossdef">Behaviors involving structuring the roles of subordinates, providing them with instructions and behaving in ways that will increase the performance of the group.

Task-oriented behaviors are directives given to employees to get things done and to ensure that organizational goals are met. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">People-oriented leader behaviors</a><span class="glossdef">Behaviors that include showing concern for employee feelings and treating employees with respect. (Also called consideration.)</span></span> include showing concern for employee feelings and treating employees with respect. People-oriented leaders genuinely care about the well-being of their employees and they demonstrate their concern in their actions and decisions. At the time, researchers thought that these two categories of behaviors were the keys to the puzzle of leadership.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn10_016">See House, R. J., &amp; Aditya, R. N. (1997). The social scientific study of leadership: Quo Vadis? <em class="emphasis">Journal of Management, 23</em>, 409–473.</span> However, research did not support the argument that demonstrating both of these behaviors would necessarily make leaders effective.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn10_017">Nystrom, P. C. (1978). Managers and the hi-hi leader myth. <em class="emphasis">Academy of Management Journal, 21</em>, 325–331.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch10_s02_s01_p02">When we look at the overall findings regarding these leader behaviors, it seems that both types of behaviors, in the aggregate, are beneficial to organizations but for different purposes. For example, when leaders demonstrate people-oriented behaviors, employees tend to be more satisfied and react more positively. However, when leaders are task-oriented, productivity tends to be a bit higher.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn10_018">Judge, T. A., Piccolo, R. F., &amp; Ilies, R. (2004).

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch10_s02_s02_p01">Another question behavioral researchers focused on was how leaders actually make decisions, and the influence of decision-making styles on leader effectiveness and employee reactions. Three types of decision-making styles were studied. In <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">authoritarian decision making</a><span class="glossdef">When leaders make the decision alone without necessarily involving employees in the decision-making process.</span></span>, leaders make the decision alone without necessarily involving employees in the decision-making process.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch10_s02_s02_p02">As with other lines of research on leadership, research did not identify one decision-making style as the best one. It seems that the effectiveness of the style the leader is using depends on the circumstances. A review of the literature shows that when leaders use more democratic decision-making styles, employees tend to be more satisfied, but the effects on decision quality or employee productivity are weaker. Moreover, instead of expecting to be involved in every single decision, employees seem to care more about the overall participativeness of the organizational climate.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn10_021">Miller, K. I., &amp; Monge, P. R. (1986). Participation, satisfaction, and productivity: A meta-analytic review. <em class="emphasis">Academy of Management Journal, 29</em>, 727–753.</span> Different types of employees may also expect different levels of involvement. In a study conducted in a research organization, scientists viewed democratic leadership most favorably and authoritarian leadership least favorably,<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn10_022">Baumgartel, H. (1957). Leadership style as a variable in research administration. <em class="emphasis">Administrative Science Quarterly, 2</em>, 344–360.</span> but employees working in large groups where opportunities for member interaction was limited preferred authoritarian leader decision making.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn10_023">Vroom, V.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch10_s02_s02_p03">Finally, the effectiveness of each style seems to depend on who is using it. There are examples of effective leaders using both authoritarian and democratic styles. For example, Larry Page and Sergey Brin at Google are known for their democratic decision-making styles.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch10_s02_s03_p01">Behavioral approaches, similar to trait approaches, fell out of favor because they neglected the environment in which behaviors are demonstrated. The hope of the researchers was that the identified behaviors would predict leadership under all circumstances, but it may be unrealistic to expect that a given set of behaviors would work under all circumstances. What makes a high school principal effective on the job may be very different from what makes a military leader, which would be different from behaviors creating success in small or large business enterprises. It turns out that specifying the conditions under which these behaviors are more effective may be a better approach.</p>

            <p class="para" id="fwk-127512-ch10_s02_s03_p02">When researchers failed to identify a set of traits that would distinguish effective from ineffective leaders, research attention turned to the study of leader behaviors. Leaders may demonstrate task-oriented and people-oriented behaviors. Both seem to be related to important outcomes, with task-oriented behaviors more strongly relating to leader effectiveness and people-oriented behaviors leading to employee satisfaction. Leaders can also make decisions using authoritarian, democratic, or laissez-faire styles. While laissez-faire has certain downsides, there is no best style and the effectiveness of each style seems to vary across situations. Because of the inconsistency of results, researchers realized the importance of the context in which leadership occurs, which paved the way to contingency theories of leadership.</p>

Instead, a better question might be: under which conditions are different leadership styles more effective? After the disappointing results of trait and behavioral approaches, several scholars developed leadership theories that specifically incorporated the role of the environment. Researchers started following a contingency approach to leadership—rather than trying to identify traits or behaviors that would be effective under all conditions, the attention moved toward specifying the situations under which different styles would be effective.</p>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-127512-ch10_s03_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Fiedler’s Contingency Theory</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch10_s03_s01_p01">The earliest and one of the most influential contingency theories was developed by Frederick Fiedler.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn10_027">Fiedler, F. (1967). <em class="emphasis">A theory of leadership effectiveness</em>, New York: McGraw-Hill; Fiedler, F. E. (1964). A contingency model of leader effectiveness. In L. Berkowitz (ed.), <em class="emphasis">Advances in experimental social psychology</em> (Vol. 1, 149–190). New York: Academic Press.</span> According to the theory, a leader’s style is measured by a scale called Least Preferred Coworker (LPC) scale. People who are filling out this survey are asked to think of a person who is their least preferred coworker. Then, they rate this person in terms of how friendly, nice, and cooperative this person is. Imagine someone you did not enjoy working with. Can you describe this person in positive terms? In other words, if you can say that the person you hated working with was still a nice person, you would have a high LPC score. This means that you have a people-oriented personality and you can separate your liking of a person from your ability to work with that person. However, if you think that the person you hated working with was also someone you did not like on a personal level, you would have a low LPC score. To you, being unable to work with someone would mean that you also dislike that person. In other words, you are a task-oriented person.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch10_s03_s01_p02">According to Fiedler’s theory, different people can be effective in different situations. The LPC score is akin to a personality trait and is not likely to change. Instead, placing the right people in the right situation or changing the situation is important to increase a leader’s effectiveness. The theory predicts that in “favorable” and “unfavorable” situations, a low LPC leader—one who has feelings of dislike for coworkers who are difficult to work with—would be successful. When situational favorableness is medium, a high LPC leader—one who is able to personally like coworkers who are difficult to work with—is more likely to succeed.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch10_s03_s01_p03">How does Fiedler determine whether a situation is favorable, medium, or unfavorable? There are three conditions creating situational favorableness: (1) leader-subordinate relations, (2) position power, and (3) task structure. If the leader has a good relationship with most people, has high position power, and the task is structured, the situation is very favorable. When the leader has low-quality relations with employees, has low position power, and the task is relatively unstructured, the situation is very unfavorable.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch10_s03_s01_p04">Research partially supports the predictions of Fiedler’s contingency theory.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn10_028">Peters, L.

Even though the theory was not supported in its entirety, it is a useful framework to think about when task- versus people-oriented leadership may be more effective. Moreover, the theory is important because of its explicit recognition of the importance of the context of leadership.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch10_s03_s02_p01">Another contingency approach to leadership is Kenneth Blanchard and Paul Hersey’s Situational Leadership Theory (SLT) which argues that leaders must use different leadership styles depending on their followers’ development level.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn10_029">Hersey, P.H., Blanchard, K.H., ' Johnson, D.E. (2007). <em class="emphasis">Management of Organizational Behavior: Leadership human resources.</em> Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall.</span> According to this model, employee readiness (defined as a combination of their competence and commitment levels) is the key factor determining the proper leadership style. This approach has been highly popular with 14 million managers across 42 countries undergoing SLT training and 70% of <em class="emphasis">Fortune</em> 500 companies employing its use.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn10_030"><a class="link" href="http://www.situational.com/Views/SituationalLeadership/RightHereRightNow.aspx">http://www.situational.com/Views/SituationalLeadership/RightHereRightNow.aspx</a></span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch10_s03_s02_p02">The model summarizes the level of directive and supportive behaviors that leaders may exhibit. The model argues that to be effective, leaders must use the right style of behaviors at the right time in each employee’s development. It is recognized that followers are key to a leader’s success. Employees who are at the earliest stages of developing are seen as being highly committed but with low competence for the tasks. Thus, leaders should be highly directive and less supportive. As the employee becomes more competent, the leader should engage in more coaching behaviors. Supportive behaviors are recommended once the employee is at moderate to high levels of competence. And finally, delegating is the recommended approach for leaders dealing with employees who are both highly committed and highly competent.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch10_s03_s03_p01">Robert House’s path-goal theory of leadership is based on the expectancy theory of motivation.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn10_032">House, R. J. (1971). A path goal theory of leader effectiveness. <em class="emphasis">Administrative Science Quarterly, 16</em>(3), 321–338.</span> Expectancy theory of motivation suggests that employees are motivated when they believe—or expect—that (1) their effort will lead to high performance, (2) their high performance will be rewarded, and (3) the rewards they will receive are valuable to them. According to the path-goal theory of leadership, the leader’s main job is to make sure that all three of these conditions exist. Thus, leaders will create satisfied and high-performing employees by making sure that employee effort leads to performance, and their performance is rewarded. The leader removes roadblocks along the way and creates an environment that subordinates find motivational.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch10_s03_s03_p02">The theory also makes specific predictions about what type of leader behavior will be effective under which circumstances.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn10_033">House, R. J. (1996). Path-goal theory of leadership: Lessons, legacy, and a reformulated theory. <em class="emphasis">Leadership Quarterly, 7</em>, 323–352; House, R. J., &amp; Mitchell, T. R. (1974). Path-goal theory of leadership. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Contemporary Business, 3</em>, 81–97.</span> The theory identifies four leadership styles. Each of these styles can be effective, depending on the characteristics of employees (such as their ability level, preferences, locus of control, achievement motivation) and characteristics of the work environment (such as the level of role ambiguity, the degree of stress present in the environment, the degree to which the tasks are unpleasant).</p>

They lead employees by clarifying role expectations, setting schedules, and making sure that employees know what to do on a given workday. The theory predicts that the directive style will work well when employees are experiencing role ambiguity on the job. If people are unclear about how to go about doing their jobs, giving them specific directions will motivate them. However, if employees already have role clarity, and if they are performing boring, routine, and highly structured jobs, giving them direction does not help. In fact, it may hurt them by creating an even more restricting atmosphere. Directive leadership is also thought to be less effective when employees have high levels of ability. When managing professional employees with high levels of expertise and job-specific knowledge, telling them what to do may create a low empowerment environment, which impairs motivation.</p>

G. 1988. <em class="emphasis">The new leadership: Managing participation in organizations</em>. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall.</span> The model starts by having leaders answer several key questions and working their way through a funnel based on their responses.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch10_s03_s04_p02">Let’s try it. Imagine that you want to help your employees lower their stress so that you can minimize employee absenteeism. There are a number of approaches you could take to reduce employee stress, such as offering gym memberships, providing employee assistance programs, establishing a nap room, and so forth. Let’s refer to the model and start with the first question. As you answer each question as high (H) or low (L), follow the corresponding path down the funnel.</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch10_s03_s04_l01">
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Decision significance</em>. The decision has high significance because the approach chosen needs to be effective at reducing employee stress for the insurance premiums to be lowered. In other words, there is a quality requirement to the decision. Follow the path through H.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Importance of commitment</em>. Does the leader need employee cooperation to implement the decision? In our example, the answer is high, because employees may simply ignore the resources if they do not like them. Follow the path through H.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Leader expertise</em>. Does the leader have all the information needed to make a high-quality decision? In our example, leader expertise is low. You do not have information regarding what your employees need or what kinds of stress reduction resources they would prefer. Follow the path through L.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Likelihood of commitment</em>. If the leader makes the decision alone, what is the likelihood that the employees would accept it? Let’s assume that the answer is Low. Based on the leader’s experience with this group, they would likely ignore the decision if the leader makes it alone. Follow the path from L.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Goal alignment</em>. Are the employee goals aligned with organizational goals? In this instance, employee and organizational goals may be aligned because you both want to ensure that employees are healthier. So let’s say the alignment is high, and follow H.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Group expertise</em>. Does the group have expertise in this decision-making area? The group in question has little information about which alternatives are costlier or more user friendly. We’ll say group expertise is low. Follow the path from L.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Team competence</em>. What is the ability of this particular team to solve the problem? Let’s imagine that this is a new team that just got together and they have little demonstrated expertise to work together effectively. We will answer this as low, or L.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch10_s03_s04_p03">Based on the answers to the questions we gave, the normative approach recommends consulting employees as a group. In other words, the leader may make the decision alone after gathering information from employees and is not advised to delegate the decision to the team or to make the decision alone with no input from the team members.</p>

            <p class="para" id="fwk-127512-ch10_s03_s04_p05">The contingency approaches to leadership describe the role the situation would play in choosing the most effective leadership style. Fiedler’s contingency theory argued that task-oriented leaders would be most effective when the situation was the most and the least favorable, whereas relationship-oriented leaders would be effective when situational favorableness was moderate. Situational Leadership Theory takes the maturity level of followers into account. House’s path-goal theory states that the leader’s job is to ensure that employees view their effort as leading to performance and increase the belief that performance would be rewarded. For this purpose, leaders would use directive, supportive, participative, and achievement-oriented leadership styles, depending on what employees needed to feel motivated. Vroom and Yetton’s normative decision model is a guide leaders can use to decide how participative they should be given decision environment characteristics.</p>

The key factor may be <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">trust</a><span class="glossdef">The belief that the other party will show integrity, fairness, and predictability in one’s actions toward the other.</span></span>. Trust is the belief that the leader will show integrity, fairness, and predictability in his or her dealings with others. Research shows that when leaders demonstrate transformational leadership behaviors, followers are more likely to trust the leader. The tendency to trust in transactional leaders is substantially lower. Because transformational leaders express greater levels of concern for people’s well-being, and appeal to people’s values, followers are more likely to believe that the leader has a trustworthy character.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn10_043">Dirks, K.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch10_s04_s01_p06">Is transformational leadership genetic? Some people assume that charisma is something people are born with. You either have charisma or you don’t. However, research does not support this idea. We must acknowledge that there is a connection between some personality traits and charisma. Specifically, people who have a neurotic personality tend to demonstrate lower levels of charisma, and people who are extraverted tend to have higher levels of charisma. However, personality explains only around 10% of the variance in charisma.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn10_044">Bono, J. E., &amp; Judge, T. A. (2004).

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch10_s04_s01_p07">Even if charisma may be teachable, a more fundamental question remains: is it really needed? Charisma is only one element of transformational leadership and leaders can be effective without charisma. In fact, charisma has a dark side. For every charismatic hero such as Lee Iacocca, Steve Jobs, and Virgin’s Sir Richard Branson, there are charismatic personalities who harmed their organizations or nations, such as Adolph Hitler of Germany and Jeff Skilling of Enron. Leadership experts warn that when organizations are in a crisis, a board of directors or hiring manager may turn to heroes who they hope will save the organization and sometimes hire people who have no other particular qualifications outside of perceived charisma.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn10_046">Khurana, R.

If you have ever been in a high-quality LMX relationship with your manager, you may attest to its advantages.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch10_s04_s02_p05">Should you worry if you do not have a high-quality relationship with your manager? One problem in a low-quality exchange is that you may not have access to the positive work environment available to the high-quality LMX members. Second, low LMX employees may feel that their situation is unfair. Even when their objective performance does not warrant it, those who have a good relationship with the leader tend to receive positive performance appraisals.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn10_059">Duarte, N. T., Goodson, J. R., &amp; Klich, N. R. (1994). Effects of dyadic quality and duration on performance appraisal. <em class="emphasis">Academy of Management Journal, 37</em>, 499–521.</span> Moreover, they are more likely to be given the benefit of the doubt. For example, when they succeed, the manager is more likely to think that they succeeded because they put forth a lot of effort and they had high abilities, whereas for low LMX members who perform objectively well, the manager is less likely to think so.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn10_060">Heneman, R.

Attributions and exchanges: The effects of interpersonal factors on the diagnosis of employee performance. <em class="emphasis">Academy of Management Journal, 32</em>, 466–476.</span> In other words, the leader may interpret the same situation differently, depending on which employee is involved and may reward low LMX employees less even when they are performing well. In short, those with a low-quality relationship with the leader may experience a work environment that may not be very supportive or fair.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch10_s04_s02_p06">Despite its negative consequences, we cannot say that all employees want to have a high-quality relationship with the leader. Some employees may genuinely dislike the leader and may not value the rewards in the leader’s possession. If the leader is not well liked in the company and is known as abusive or unethical, being close to such a person may imply guilt by association. For employees who have no interest in advancing their careers in the current company (such as a student employee who is working in retail but has no interest in retail as a career), having a low-quality exchange may afford the opportunity to just do one’s job without having to go above and beyond these job requirements. Finally, not all leaders are equally capable of influencing their employees by having a good relationship with their employees: It also depends on the power and influence of the leader in the overall company and how the leader himself or herself is treated within the company. Leaders who are more powerful will have more to share with employees who are close to them.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn10_061">Erdogan, B., &amp; Enders, J. (2007).

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch10_s04_s02_p07">What LMX theory implies for leaders is that one way of influencing employees is through the types of relationships leaders form with their employees. These relationships develop naturally because of the work-related and personal interactions between the manager and the employee. Because they occur naturally, some leaders may not be aware of the power that lies in them. These relationships have an important influence over employee attitudes and behaviors. In the worst case, they have the potential to create a negative work environment characterized by favoritism and unfairness. Therefore, managers are advised to be aware of how they build these relationships; put forth effort in cultivating these relationships consciously; be open to forming good relationships to people from all backgrounds regardless of their permanent characteristics such as sex, race, age, or disability status; and prevent these relationships from leading to an unfair work environment.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch10_s04_s03_p01">The early 21st century has been marked by a series of highly publicized corporate ethics scandals: between 2000 and 2003, we witnessed Enron, WorldCom, Arthur Andersen, Qwest, and Global Crossing shake investor confidence in corporations and leaders. The importance of ethical leadership and keeping long-term interests of stakeholders in mind is becoming more widely acknowledged.</p>

According to this approach, the primary mission of the leader is to develop employees and help them reach their goals. Servant leaders put their employees first, understand their personal needs and desires, empower them, and help them develop in their careers. Unlike mainstream management approaches, the overriding objective in servant leadership is not necessarily getting employees to contribute to organizational goals. Instead, servant leaders feel an obligation to their employees, customers, and the external community. Employee happiness is seen as an end in itself, and servant leaders sometimes sacrifice their own well-being to help employees succeed. In addition to a clear focus on having a moral compass, servant leaders are also interested in serving the community. In other words, their efforts to help others are not restricted to company insiders, and they are genuinely concerned about the broader community surrounding their company.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn10_062">Greenleaf, R.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch10_s04_s03_p03">Even though servant leadership has some overlap with other leadership approaches such as transformational leadership, its explicit focus on ethics, community development, and self-sacrifice are distinct characteristics of this leadership style.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch10_s04_s03_p04">Servant leadership is a tough transition for many managers who are socialized to put their own needs first, be driven by success, and tell people what to do. In fact, many of today’s corporate leaders are not known for their humility! However, leaders who have adopted this approach attest to its effectiveness. David Wolfskehl, of Action Fast Print in New Jersey, founded his printing company when he was 24. He marks the day he started asking employees what he can do for them as the beginning of his company’s new culture. In the next two years, his company increased its productivity by 30%.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn10_066">Buchanan, L. (May, 2007).

        <h2 class="title editable block">Authentic Leadership</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch10_s04_s04_p01">Leaders have to be a lot of things to a lot of people. They operate within different structures, work with different types of people, and they have to be adaptable. At times, it may seem that a leader’s smartest strategy would be to act as a social chameleon, changing his or her style whenever doing so seems advantageous. But this would lose sight of the fact that effective leaders have to stay true to themselves. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">The authentic leadership approach</a><span class="glossdef">Effective leaders who stay true to themselves.</span></span> embraces this value: its key advice is “be yourself.” Think about it: We all have different backgrounds, different life experiences, and different role models. These trigger events over the course of our lifetime that shape our values, preferences, and priorities. Instead of trying to fit into societal expectations about what a leader should be like, act like, or look like, authentic leaders derive their strength from their own past experiences. Thus, one key characteristic of authentic leaders is that they are self-aware. They are introspective, understand where they are coming from, and have a thorough understanding of their own values and priorities. Second, they are not afraid to act the way they are. In other words, they have high levels of personal integrity. They say what they think. They behave in a way consistent with their values—they practice what they preach. Instead of trying to imitate other great leaders, they find their style in their own personality and life experiences.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn10_067">Avolio, B. J., &amp; Gardner, W.

Therefore, in addition to self-reflection, feedback from others is needed to gain a true understanding of one’s behavior and effect on others. Authentic leadership is viewed as a potentially influential style because employees are more likely to trust such a leader. Moreover, working for authentic leaders is likely to lead to greater levels of satisfaction, performance, and overall well-being on the part of employees.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn10_069">Walumbwa, F.

            <h3 class="title">Key Takeaway</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-127512-ch10_s04_s04_p04">Contemporary approaches to leadership include transformational leadership, leader-member exchange, servant leadership, and authentic leadership. The transformational leadership approach highlights the importance of leader charisma, inspirational motivation, intellectual stimulation, and individualized consideration as methods of influence. Its counterpart is the transactional leadership approach, in which the leader focuses on getting employees to achieve organizational goals. According to leader-member exchange (LMX) approach, the unique, trust-based relationships leaders develop with employees is the key to leadership effectiveness. Recently, leadership scholars started to emphasize the importance of serving others and adopting a customer-oriented view in leadership; another recent focus is on the importance of being true to oneself as a leader. While each leadership approach focuses on a different element of leadership, effective leaders will need to change their style based on the demands of the situation as well as using their own values and moral compass.</p>
