    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch04_s06_p01">Mission and vision are concepts that can be applied to you, personally, well beyond their broader relevance to the P-O-L-C framework. Personal mission and vision communicate the direction in which you are headed, as well as providing some explanation for why you are choosing one direction or set of objectives over others. Thinking about and writing down mission and vision statements for your life can help provide you with a compass as you work toward your own goals and objectives.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Your Mission and Vision</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch04_s06_s01_p01">Note that the development of a personal mission and vision, and then a strategy for achieving them, are exactly the opposite of what most people follow. Most people do not plan further ahead than their next job or activity (if they plan their career at all). They take a job because it looks attractive, and then they see what they can do with it. We advocate looking as far into the future as you can and deciding where you want to end up and what steps will lead you there. In that way, your life and your career fit into some intelligent plan, and you are in control of your own life.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch04_s06_s01_s01_p01">The first step in planning a career is obviously a long-term goal. Where do you want to end up, ultimately? Do you really want to be a CEO or president of the United States, now that you know what it costs to be either one? There are a couple basic parts to this process.</p>

                <li>Fit squarely in the three circles of (a) what you are deeply passionate about (including your core values and purpose), (b) what drives your economic logic, and (c) what differentiates you (what you can be the best in the world at).</li>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch04_s06_s01_s04_p01">Once the vision is set, you have to develop some long-term goal (or goals), then intermediate-term goals, and so on. If you want to be President, what jobs will you have to take first to get there and when do you have to get these jobs? Where should you live? What training do you need? What political connections do you need? Then you have to set up an orderly plan for obtaining the connections and training that you need and getting into these steppingstone jobs.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch04_s06_s01_s04_p02">Finally, you need to establish short-term goals to fit clearly into a coherent plan for your entire career. Your next job (if you are now a fairly young person) should be picked not only for its salary or for its opportunities for advancement but for its chances to provide you with the training and connections you need to reach your long-term goals. The job that is superficially attractive to you because it has a high salary, offers the opportunity for immediate advancement, or is located in a desirable place may be a mistake from the standpoint of your long-term career.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch04_s06_s01_s05_p01">Former business school professor, entrepreneur (founder of www.quintcareers.com), and colleague Randall S. Hansen, PhD, has done a masterful job of assembling resources that aim to help your career, including an excellent five-step plan for creating personal mission statements. With his generous permission, he has allowed us to reproduce his five-step plan—adapted by us to encompass both mission and vision—in this section.</p>

                <h2 class="title editable block">The Five-Step Plan</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch04_s06_s01_s05_s01_p01">A large percentage of companies, including most of the <em class="emphasis">Fortune</em> 500, have corporate mission and vision statements.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn04_034">Retrieved October 29, 2008, from <a class="link" href="http://www.quintcareers.com/creating_personal_mission_statements.html">http://www.quintcareers.com/creating_personal_mission_statements.html</a>. Reproduced and adapted with written permission from Randall S. Hansen. The content of this work is his, and any errors or omissions are our responsibility.</span> Mission and vision statements are designed to provide direction and thrust to an organization, an enduring statement of purpose. A mission and vision statement act as an invisible hand that guides the people in the organization. A mission and vision statement explains the organization’s reason for being and answers the question, “What business are we in?”</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch04_s06_s01_s05_s01_p02">A personal mission and vision statement is a bit different from a company mission statement, but the fundamental principles are the same. Writing a personal mission and vision statement offers the opportunity to establish what’s important and perhaps make a decision to stick to it before we even start a career. Or it enables us to chart a new course when we’re at a career crossroads. Steven Covey (in <em class="emphasis">First Things First</em>) refers to developing a mission and vision statement as “connecting with your own unique purpose and the profound satisfaction that comes from fulfilling it.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn04_035">Covey, S. R. (1994). <em class="emphasis">First Things First</em>. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster.</span></p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch04_s06_s01_s05_s01_p03">A personal mission and vision statement helps job seekers identify their core values and beliefs. Michael Goodman (in <em class="emphasis">The Potato Chip Difference: How to Apply Leading Edge Marketing Strategies to Landing the Job You Want</em>) states that a personal mission statement is “an articulation of what you’re all about and what success looks like to you.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-127512-fn04_036">Goodman, M. (2001). <em class="emphasis">The Potato Chip Difference</em>. New York: Dialogue Press.</span> A personal mission and vision statement also allows job seekers to identify companies that have similar values and beliefs and helps them better assess the costs and benefits of any new career opportunity.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch04_s06_s01_s05_s01_p04">The biggest problem most job seekers face is not in wanting to have a personal mission and vision statement but actually writing it. So, to help you get started on your personal mission and vision statement, here is a five-step mission/vision-building process. Take as much time on each step as you need, and remember to dig deeply to develop a mission and vision statement that is both authentic and honest. To help you better see the process, Professor Hansen included an example of one friend’s process in developing her mission and vision statements.</p>

                        <li>Imagine yourself 132 years old and surrounded by your descendants or those descendants of your friends. You are in a warm and relaxed atmosphere (such as around a fireplace). What would you say to them about what is important in life? This exercise is designed to access the values and principles that guide your life.</li>
                        <li>Imagine that it is your 70th birthday (or another milestone in your life). You have been asked by national print media to write a press release about your achievements. Consider what you would want your family, friends, coworkers in your profession and in your community to say about you. What difference would you like to have made in their lives? How do you want to be remembered? This is designed to inventory your actions and accomplishments in all areas of your life.</li>

Then write a rough draft (a page of any length) of your mission statement. Remember that it should describe what you want to do and who you want to be. This is not a job description. Carry it with you, post copies in visible places at home and work, and revise and evaluate. Be patient with yourself. The process is as important as the outcome. After a few weeks, write another draft. Ask yourself whether your statement was based on proven principles that you believe in, if you feel direction, motivation, and inspiration when you read it. Over time, reviewing and evaluating will keep you abreast of your own development.</p>

Spend some time thinking about your priorities in life and the goals you have for yourself. Make a list of your personal goals, perhaps in the short term (up to three years) and the long term (beyond three years).</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-127512-ch04_s06_s01_s05_s01_p22">Final thoughts: A personal mission and vision statement is, of course, personal. But if you want to see whether you have been honest in developing your personal mission and vision statement, we suggest sharing the results of this process with one or more people who are close to you. Ask for their feedback. Finally, remember that mission and vision statements are not meant to be written once and blasted into stone. You should set aside some time annually to review your career, job, goals, and mission and vision statements—and make adjustments as necessary.</p>

Just as you might do in developing an organization’s vision statement, you were encouraged to think of a big, hairy audacious goal as a starting point. You also learned a five-step process for developing a personal vision statement.</p>
